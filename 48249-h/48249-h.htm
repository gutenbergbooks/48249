<div class="poetry-head"> “Lost! lost! lost!”</div>

<p>The sun had set amid angry clouds; deep shadows
already filled the recesses of the forest through
which the iron horse went thundering on its way,
while an icy wind, bringing with it frequent dashes
of rain and sleet, swept through the leafless branches
of the trees, tossing them wildly against a dull leaden
sky.</p>

<p>A lady, gazing out into the gathering gloom, started
with a sudden exclamation of surprise and dismay.
Her husband leaned hastily past her to see
what had called it forth; then, with a smile at his
own folly in forgetting that at the rate of speed with
which they were moving the object, whatever it
might be, was already out of sight, settled himself
back again, bending a look of mild inquiry upon her
agitated countenance.</p>

<p>She shivered, and drawing her shawl more closely
about her, put her lips to his ear, that she might be
heard above the noise of the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was a face, John&mdash;a woman’s face upturned to
the sky, wan, distressed, wretched, with great sorrowful
eyes. It just gleamed out upon me for an instant
as we swept by, and was gone. Poor thing!
poor thing! she must be in sore trouble.”</p>

<p>He shook his head with a smile of conscious superiority
of wisdom.</p>

<p>“Don’t let your imagination run away with you,
my dear, or waste your sympathy upon a wandering
gypsy, who would not exchange places with you if
she could.”</p>

<p>The train was slackening its speed, and they could
now converse with ease.</p>

<p>“She is no ordinary tramp,” was the quick, earnest
reply. “And if ever bitter, hopeless grief and
despair were written on a human face, they were on
hers. I wish we could go back and find her.”</p>

<p>“Quite impossible, Dolly; so let us talk of something
more agreeable.”</p>

<p>“We change cars soon, don’t we?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Worse than that; we get out at the next station
and wait there two mortal hours for another
train.”</p>

<p>“Clearfield Station!” shouted the conductor,
throwing open the car door.</p>

<p>An acre or two of ground had been cleared of
trees, though many of the stumps were still standing;
there was no appearance of a town; only a depot
and a few shanties scattered here and there, the
whole hemmed in by the forest, except on the two
sides where the road had cut its way through.</p>

<p>The train stopped, and John and Dolly&mdash;otherwise
Mr. and Mrs. Kemper&mdash;alighted, and the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
hurried his wife out of the rain and sleet into the
depot.</p>

<p>A very forlorn place it looked with its rusty stove,
filthy floor and windows, and hard, straight-backed
wooden chairs and settee, which gave small promise
of rest or ease to the delayed and weary traveller.</p>

<p>“What a wretched hole!” said Mrs. Kemper,
sending a rueful glance from side to side. “How
long did you say we’d have to stay here, John?”</p>

<p>“Two hours, Dolly. Here, take this chair by the
fire, and I’ll go and see what can be done.”</p>

<p>He came back presently, and pointing through the
window, “You see that light yonder, Dolly?” he said.
“It comes from a shanty some hundred yards away,
where they tell me we can at least find cleanliness
and a cup of hot tea. There seems a lull in the
storm at this moment, too; shall we go and try it?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” she answered, rising with alacrity
and taking his offered arm. “I presume the walking
is bad enough, but my boots are thick.”</p>

<p>Picking their way carefully between stumps and
pools of water, just visible in the deepening gloom,
they reached the place.</p>

<p>It was a long, low building of rudest structure, its
walls rough boards nailed on horizontally, leaving
large cracks between, with merely a covering of
painted canvas upon the outside to keep wind and
rain at bay. The gable-end with its one door and
window, in which burned the lamp that had guided
them, faced the road.</p>

<p>Entering, our travellers found themselves in a
small waiting-room, very simply furnished, but invitingly
warm, clean, and tidy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>A neatly-dressed young woman greeted them with
a pleasant “Good-evening,” and throwing open an
inner door, asked if they would walk out to supper.</p>

<p>“I should prefer just taking something here,” said
Mrs. Kemper, shrinking back at the sight of a long
table with only a number of rough-looking men
about it. “Couldn’t you bring me a cup of hot tea
and whatever you have to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, of course;” and the girl vanished
to return presently with the tea, a piece of steak,
bread, butter, and hot corn-cakes.</p>

<p>Out in the forest a woman was battling with the
storm&mdash;a woman with a child in her arms. A slight,
willowy form was hers, once the perfection of grace
in outline and movement, now bent and staggering
with weakness; a face whose bright, soft eyes, glowing
cheeks, and ruby lips were not long ago the admiration
or envy of many, though now wan and
pinched with famine and wasting sickness.</p>

<p>It was the same face that Mrs. Kemper had seen
from the car window, upturned despairingly to the
stormy sky as for a moment the weary wanderer
paused and leaned against a tree by the roadside to
gather strength and breath for renewed exertion.</p>

<p>Both were well-nigh spent, and hope so nearly
dead within her that, but for the babe in her arms,
she had lain her down to die there in the lonely
wood, with no human creature near to pity or console.</p>

<p>But mother-love was stronger than the love of life:
she had taken the thin faded shawl from her own
shoulders to wrap it about the little one, and so had
kept it comparatively warm and dry, while she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was drenched to the skin. Her limbs were almost
benumbed with cold, and the cutting wind, as it
dashed the rain and sleet full in her face, seemed
piercing to her very vitals.</p>

<p>Twilight was fast deepening into night; the way
grew dark and slippery; now her feet sank in the
mud, and she struggled out only to slip into a pool
of water, or to stumble and fall over a stump or log,
or to catch and tear her clothing on some thorny
bush.</p>

<p>The pauses for breath grew more frequent, the
steps, as she moved forward again, weaker and more
tottering, the weary arms could scarce sustain the
weight of the child, and she knew not how far
distant was the nearest human habitation. She was
about to give up in utter despair, when the gleam
of a not very distant light seen through the trees inspired
her with new hope and energy.</p>

<p>She pressed forward, and presently emerged from
the wood and found herself at Clearfield Station, with
the light in the window of the shanty inn shining
out ruddily not a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>She crept to the door and knocked faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemper, who had just finished his supper,
rose and opened it.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said. “This is a public house,
and I presume no one will object,” he added, catching
sight of the ragged, dripping figure.</p>

<p>She stepped in, staggered to the fire and dropped
down on the floor beside it.</p>

<p>“Drunk!” he muttered, with a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>“No, no, John! she is ill&mdash;starving perhaps!&mdash;poor
thing! poor thing!” cried his keener-sighted wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
springing forward, barely in time to catch the sleeping
babe as the weary arms relaxed their hold and the
wanderer sank back against the wall in a state of
semi-insensibility, her eyes closed and not a trace of
color on cheek or lip.</p>

<p>“She’s dying!” exclaimed Mr. Kemper in a
frightened whisper; and rushing to the inner door,
“Somebody run for a doctor, quick! here is a woman
who seems to be very ill!” he cried hurriedly.</p>

<p>“None to be had within three or four mile,” returned
a gruff voice from the table. “What ails the
woman? and who is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but something must be done.”</p>

<p>“Give her a cup of your tea, Irene,” said the voice.</p>

<p>“A few drops of brandy from the flask in our
luncheon-basket, John,” said his wife. “I always
take it along in case of sickness, you know.”</p>

<p>But the child, a girl of eighteen months, woke with
a cry, “Mamma! mamma!” and at the sound the
mother’s eyes unclosed.</p>

<p>“Give her to me&mdash;my little Ethel!” she said
faintly.</p>

<p>“You are ill, my good woman, not able to hold
her,” Mrs. Kemper said, as she reluctantly complied
with the request.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I&mdash;have eaten nothing to-day&mdash;and have
walked many miles.”</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” exclaimed Irene, the kind-hearted
mistress of the shanty, coming in with the tea.
“Here, drink this, and I’ll bring you some supper.
You look more dead than alive, and the rain has soaked
you through and through. Dear, dear! you’ll
catch your death o’ cold!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>She raised the wanderer’s head as she spoke, and
held the cup to her lips.</p>

<p>It was eagerly drained to the last drop, and seemed
to revive the poor creature greatly.</p>

<p>Food was brought, and the babe devoured it as if
half famished, but the mother ate sparingly. She was
evidently very ill, almost dying, thought those about
her, and hastened to do all in their power for her relief
and comfort.</p>

<p>Plainly she was, as Mrs. Kemper had said, no common
tramp: there was lady-like refinement in face,
voice, and manner; her accent was pure, her speech
correct and even elegant, as, in answer to kindly
inquiries, she gave a brief account of the causes of
her present sad condition.</p>

<p>At an early age she had been left an orphan and
without any natural protector; had married some
three years ago, and two years later her husband had
died, leaving her penniless, in feeble health, and with
a babe to support. She had managed for a time to
earn a scanty living by needlework, but there was
little demand for it where she lived, and wages were
very low; so, taking her child in her arms, she had
set out in search of other employment or a better
location.</p>

<p>It had proved a long, weary quest, and here she
was, in utter destitution and about, she greatly
feared, to die, and leave her helpless babe with none
to love or care for it.</p>

<p>With the last words a great sob burst from her
bosom; and clasping the little creature close,</p>

<p>“Ah my darling, my little Ethel, if I might but
take you with me!” she moaned in anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah now don’t take on so,” Irene said kindly.
“You’ll be better to-morrow. Walking all day in
the cold, and gettin’ wet too, it’s no wonder you’re
down-hearted like; but cheer up, you’ll get over it
and find work, and maybe see as good days as ever
you did.”</p>

<p>The wanderer thanked her with a grateful look, as
she continued silently to caress Ethel; the child, no
longer cold and hungry, hanging about her mother’s
neck, stroking her face lovingly, and prattling in innocent
glee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kemper watched her with delighted, longing
eyes, the tears starting to them once and again.</p>

<p>“What a lovely, darling little creature she is!” she
whispered to her husband; “just the age our Nellie
was.” And then she added a few words in a still
lower tone.</p>

<p>He nodded acquiescence; and turning to the mother,
said that he and his wife would like to adopt
the child and bring it up as their own; that they
would do so if she would at once give it up entirely
to them.</p>

<p>A look of mingled grief and terror came over her
face at the bare suggestion. She clutched her treasure
in a death-like grasp.</p>

<p>“No, no! how could I? how could I?” she cried,
“my baby! my precious baby! my all! no, no,
never, never!”</p>

<p>“Take time to consider,” he said soothingly. “I
am sorry to distress you, but, as you have yourself
said, your child will soon need another protector,
and it is very unlikely that another will be readily
found to do as well by her as we would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>“But wait&mdash;wait till I am gone!” she moaned.
“She is my all, my all! Oh, ’tis hard to die and
leave her! My baby, my baby, your mother’s heart
will break!” and the tears fell like rain on the wondering
little face upturned to hers.</p>

<p>“Don’t ky, Ethel’s mamma! Ethel love ’oo!”
cooed the babe, lifting her dress to wipe away the
tears, while with the other arm she clung about her
neck, then kissing her wet cheek again and again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kemper, with great tears of sympathy rolling
down her own cheeks, knelt at the wanderer’s side,
and, taking one thin hand in hers, said:</p>

<p>“I feel for you, my poor, poor friend! I do indeed.
I know a mother’s heart, for I once had a little
one like this, and when death snatched her from
me I would gladly have gone down into the grave
with her, for she was my only one. That was ten
years ago. I have never had another, and it is not
likely I ever shall; and now when you feel that you
must leave this darling, will you not let me have her
to fill the vacant place in my heart&mdash;in <em>our</em> hearts
and home, for my husband will love her dearly too,
and be a good father to her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, gladly, when&mdash;when I am gone!”</p>

<p>“But we cannot wait; we must go on our journey
in another hour. And it will be to you only
parting a little sooner; for her good too. You cannot
be selfish where your dear child is concerned.”</p>

<p>“No, no, God knows I would suffer anything for
her. I love her better than my own soul. But I
cannot give her up till&mdash;I must. Have pity, have
pity! she is all I have left&mdash;parents, sister, husband,
home, all&mdash;everything gone but her&mdash;my precious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
precious baby! Oh, don’t, don’t ask me to let her
go from my arms while I live!” she pleaded in heart-broken
accents, and with bitter sobs and tears.</p>

<p>“We would not if it could be helped,” sobbed Mrs.
Kemper, “but it cannot; and for her sake you will
give her to us now?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemper joined his arguments and entreaties
to those of his wife. They engaged to do all in their
power for the well-being and happiness of the little
one, treating her in every respect as if she were their
own offspring, on the one condition that she should
be given up entirely to them, never to be claimed by
any one&mdash;even a near relative, or the mother herself,
should she by any possibility survive.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemper had torn a leaf from his note-book,
and, with pen and ink furnished by Irene, had drawn
up a deed of gift to that effect, which he was urging
the mother to sign.</p>

<p>“No, no! I can never, <em>never</em> agree to <em>that</em>!” she
cried in reference to the last stipulation. “Live without
my own precious child! never, never!”</p>

<p>“A mere form,” he said. “You cannot live many
days, my good woman; do you not feel that it is so?”</p>

<p>She but clasped her child closer, while her whole
frame shook with the violence of her emotion. She
seemed almost ready to expire with the mental anguish
superadded to her great physical prostration.</p>

<p>At length the distant rumble of an approaching
train was heard.</p>

<p>“There, you have but a moment left for decision,”
said the gentleman; “that is the train we must take.
Will you sacrifice your child’s welfare or your own
feelings?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>She was now seated beside the table, her child
asleep in her arms.</p>

<p>He laid the deed of gift he had made out before
her as he spoke, and put a pen between her fingers.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his with a look of wild anguish
fit to move a heart of stone.</p>

<p>He simply pointed to the unconscious babe.</p>

<p>She looked at it, seized the pen, hurriedly scrawled
a name at the foot of the deed, and fell back fainting.</p>

<p>But the shrill whistle of the locomotive and the
thunder of the train close at hand aroused her.</p>

<p>“We must go now; let me take her,” Mrs. Kemper
was saying in tones tremulous with great compassion.
“I will love her dearly, dearly; I will cherish
her as the apple of my eye. Let me wrap this
warm shawl around her.”</p>

<p>“No, Dolly, I’ll carry her,” Mr. Kemper said, in
a tone of half-suppressed delight, as he finished buttoning
up his overcoat after safely depositing the
note-book, with the deed of gift, in an inner pocket.</p>

<p>But silently the mother put them both aside.
There was agony in her wan, emaciated face. She
could not speak for the choking in her throat; but
she strained the child to her heart, laid her cold white
cheek to its warm and rosy face and kissed it passionately
again and again.</p>

<p>“We must go,” repeated Mrs. Kemper. “Oh, my
heart aches for you, but we <em>must</em> go!”</p>

<p>“We must indeed, poor thing! there’s not a moment
to be lost,” added Mr. Kemper, taking the
child from her with gentle force. “Here, this will
supply your needs while you live, I think,” putting
a roll of notes into her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>She dropped them as if a serpent had stung her,
and with a wild cry rushed after him, as, hastily
wrapping a shawl about the infant, he ran with it
toward the train, his wife close behind him.</p>

<p>They had already tarried almost too long; had
scarcely time to gain the platform of the nearest car
ere the train swept swiftly on its way.</p>

<p>“My child, my child! give me back my child!”
shrieked the distracted mother, pursuing with outstretched
arms, the storm beating pitilessly on her
uncovered head, her long, dark hair streaming in the
wind.</p>

<p>For a moment she seemed to fly over the ground,
love and despair lending her unnatural strength and
speed; the next&mdash;as the train was lost to sight in the
depths of the forest&mdash;she tottered and would have
fallen but for the strong arm of a kindly switchman,
who, hastily setting down his lantern, sprang forward
just in time to save her.</p>

<p>“She’s in a dead faint, poor thing!” he muttered
to himself. “Here, Bill,” to a comrade, “take a
holt and help me to carry her into the depot.”</p>

<p>“Who is she, Jack? an’ what ails her?” asked
Bill, hurrying up and holding his lantern high, while
he peered curiously into the white, unconscious face.</p>

<p>“No time to talk till we git her in out o’ the wet,”
returned Jack gruffly.</p>

<p>They laid her down on the settee.</p>

<p>“She’s a human critter and in sore trouble, that’s
all I know,” remarked Jack quietly, drawing his coat-sleeve
across his eyes as the two stood gazing upon
the pitiful sight.</p>

<p>A light covered wagon had just drawn up at the
depot door, and out of it quickly stepped an elderly
gentleman. Hurrying in with youthful alacrity, he
glanced with eager haste from side to side of the
dingy apartment. A look of keen disappointment
swept over his features, changing instantly to one of
grief and terror as his eye fell upon the little group
about the settee.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;who&mdash;who is it? What has happened?” he
asked tremulously, turning pale, and laying his hand
on a chair-back as if to steady himself; then heaving
a sigh of relief as the men stepped aside, giving
him a view of the prostrate form, Jack Strong saying:</p>

<p>“It’s not Mr. Rolfe, sir, but on’y a poor female
woman as has fainted. Mr. Rolfe, he didn’t come.
Somebody’s took her child away from her, I do
believe. Leastways she was screamin’ for it, and
runnin’ arter the cars, which of course she couldn’t
ketch. I reckon she’s sick too. Looks mighty bad,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“So she does, poor creature!” said the gentleman,
approaching. “We must do something at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
bring her to. Water, Jack&mdash;quick! I wish Dr.
Wright was here.”</p>

<p>But at that instant a moan came from the pale lips,
and the eyes&mdash;large, dark, and lustrous&mdash;opened wide.
They caught the pitying gaze of the new-comer.
Feebly she lifted her arms toward him, then dropped
them again, faintly murmuring:</p>

<p>“You have been gone so long, father, and I am ill&mdash;dying.
Take me home.”</p>

<p>“That I will!” he said, obeying a sudden generous
impulse, for he was much moved by the appeal.
“Jack!”</p>

<p>“Do you know her, sir, Mr. Heywood?” queried
the switchman in surprise.</p>

<p>“No more than you do, Jack, but surely she is in
sore need of help, and I’m able to give it. In fact,
I think it is a plain call of Providence. I’ve brought
the dearborn, thinking to take home Rolfe and his luggage;
but he hasn’t come, and here it is&mdash;the very
thing to carry her in.</p>

<p>“But wait a moment; what do you know of her?
Is she quite alone?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t know nothin’ more than&mdash;” began
the switchman, but was interrupted by the hurried
entrance of Irene.</p>

<p>“Is she livin’? where is she?” asked the girl,
rushing into their midst breathless with haste and
excitement. “Here’s some money the gentleman
gave her, and she throwed it on the floor; I reckon
because she thought ’twas paying her for the child.”</p>

<p>“My child! my Ethel!” cried the wanderer,
starting up, but only to fall back again, overcome
with weakness. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>“Come to mother, darling, come!”
she murmured, her hand feebly extended, her eyes
closed, while she moved her head restlessly from side
to side.</p>

<p>“She’s out of her mind,” whispered the girl.</p>

<p>Mr. Heywood nodded assent; and drawing Irene
aside, asked a few rapid questions, in reply to which
she imparted all the information she could give in
regard to the sufferer.</p>

<p>All he heard but strengthened his resolution to
befriend the poor creature, and he at once set about
making preparations for removing her to his own
house, some three miles distant.</p>

<p>A quantity of clean straw was bestowed in the bottom
of the dearborn, a buffalo-robe laid over it, making
a not uncomfortable bed. On this the invalid
was gently placed, and carefully covered with a second
robe.</p>

<p>She made no resistance. She was quite delirious,
and knew nothing of what was passing around her.</p>

<p>“Carefully now, Mike,” the old gentleman said,
taking his seat beside the coachman; “the poor
thing’s in no state to bear unnecessary jolting.”</p>

<p>“Hallo! hold on there a minute; here’s a message
for you, Mr. Heywood!” cried the telegraph operator,
rushing out from his office with a piece of paper
in his hand. “From Rolfe, sir; he’s all right&mdash;missed
the train, that’s all; will be here to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“God willing,” added the old gentleman reverently,
taking the paper with trembling fingers;
“and His name be praised that my boy is safe. I’m
obliged to you, Dixon.”</p>

<p>The storm had increased in violence: the showers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of rain and sleet now fell almost without intermission,
and the wind blew with a fury that threatened
danger from falling trees as they drove on through
the forest, their progress necessarily slow because of
the state of the road and the intense darkness.</p>

<p>The raging of the tempest was not favorable to
conversation, and few words passed between them,
while the woman for the most part slept heavily under
the influence of a narcotic, only a moan or a muttered
word or two now and then escaping her lips.</p>

<p>Mr. Heywood was one of the early settlers of Iowa.
He had invested largely in land on his arrival, and in
the course of years had, by its rise in value, become
quite wealthy. The log cabin in the wilderness, in
which the early years of his married life were passed,
and where his children had first seen the light, was
now replaced by a large, handsome brick house standing
in the midst of well-kept gardens and cultivated
fields. “Sweetbrier” Mrs. Heywood had named
the place, and it was often pointed out to strangers
as one of the finest residences in the county. The
Heywoods had not, however, been exempt from
trials: four out of six children had passed away from
earth. Of the two survivors, the eldest, a son, had
emigrated to California several years before this, and
was now returning for his first visit to his old home,
parents, and sister.</p>

<p>Ada, the daughter, a fair girl of eighteen, was full
ten years younger than Rolfe, he being the eldest
and she the youngest born.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room at Sweetbrier mother and
daughter eagerly awaited the coming of the loved
travellers&mdash;father and son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was tastefully furnished, a bright wood
fire crackled cheerily on the hearth, and an astral
lamp on the centre-table shed a soft, mellow light
on two happy faces, on books, pictures, lounges, and
easy chairs.</p>

<p>In the adjoining room a table was set out with
snowy damask, fine French china, and silverware, in
readiness for the feast preparing in the kitchen,
whither Mrs. Heywood occasionally hied to oversee
the labors of her cook.</p>

<p>“How the wind does blow!” she remarked, returning
from one of these little excursions. “It’s a
dreadful night for your father to be out. I wish
Rolfe had come yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had,” said Ada, running to the window.
“How very dark it is! I’m sure they can’t
see the road, or any tree that may be blown down
across it. Mother, I am afraid they’ve met with
some accident, for it’s nearly ten o’clock&mdash;high time
they were here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not distress ourselves, dear, with anticipating
evil; both we and they are in the Lord’s keeping,”
replied the mother, striving to put away anxious
thoughts. “I think Peace and Plenty will be
able to find the road; I never knew them to miss it
yet, even in nights as dark as this. Come, sit down
by the fire, Ada, and read me again the letter you
received from your brother the other day; that will
help to while away the time till they come.”</p>

<p>The girl complied, drawing the letter from her
pocket, and seating herself on an ottoman at her
mother’s feet.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said, refolding the missive, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Rolfe has never married. I pity the somebody that’s
missing such a good husband.”</p>

<p>“Time enough yet,” said the mother, smiling;
“he is only twenty-eight. There! I hear the rattle
of the wheels.” Both sprang up and hurried to the
outer door, each heart beating high with delighted
expectation.</p>

<p>They were just in time to see Mr. Heywood alight
from the vehicle, which had already drawn up before
the entrance.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, hurrying up the steps into
the portico, “don’t be alarmed. I have not brought
our boy, but he’s safe and well; sent me a telegram
to say he’d missed the train, and will be here to-morrow,
God willing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, with a sigh, “it’s a sore disappointment,
but I’m thankful it’s no worse. You’ve
had a hard ride, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have brought an unexpected guest with me,” he
interrupted hastily. “Mary, dear, remembering the
Master’s words, ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these, ye have done it unto me,’
you’ll not object to taking her in, for she may be
one of His.”</p>

<p>“Who, Joseph?” she asked in a startled tone.</p>

<p>“A poor, forsaken, dying creature, Mary; I’ve not
been able to learn her name.” And he hurried to
the assistance of Mike, who had fastened his horses
and was preparing to lift the woman from the
wagon.</p>

<p>Taking each an end of the buffalo-robe on which
she lay, they carried her in between them and laid
her gently down before the sitting-room fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood had hastened to order a room and
bed made ready, and now, returning with such restoratives
as were at hand, knelt by the side of the
sufferer to apply them.</p>

<p>“How young! how pretty!” she said in surprise,
gazing down at the unconscious face with its
broad white brow, cheeks now slightly flushed with
fever, sweet mouth, and large, lustrous eyes, which
suddenly opened wide upon her, then closed again,
while a deep moan escaped the lips and the head
moved restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p>“She’s very ill, poor dear!” said the old lady.
“Ada, my child, don’t come near lest her disease
should be contagious. We ought to have the doctor
here as soon as possible, Joseph.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go for him,” said Mike, starting for the door.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Ada, “there’s a horse galloping
up the drive. Who can it be coming at this hour on
such a night?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood rose to her feet, and they all stood
for a moment intently listening; then, at a “Hallo!”
from a familiar voice,</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the doctor himself!” they exclaimed
simultaneously, the old gentleman and Ada running
out to the hall to greet him.</p>

<p>He had already alighted from his horse, and was
coming in.</p>

<p>“All well?” he asked almost breathlessly, not
even pausing to say good-evening.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no!” returned Mr. Heywood. “This way
as quick as you can, doctor; we’ve a poor creature
here who is very sick indeed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that explains it,” remarked the physician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as if thinking aloud, while hastily following his
host.</p>

<p>He pronounced his patient in a brain-fever and
very ill indeed.</p>

<p>“The poor creature (evidently a lady) must have
been half famished for months past, and has hardly
strength to cope with the disease,” he said, “yet with
the blessing of Providence upon skilful treatment
and the best of nursing”&mdash;with a bow and a smile
directed to Mrs. Heywood&mdash;“she may possibly recover.”</p>

<p>“Poor dear! my heart is strongly drawn to her,”
said the old lady, twinkling away a tear as she bent
over the bed where they had laid the sufferer, and
softly smoothed back the hair from the pale forehead,
“and she shall not die for lack of anything it
is in my power to do for her.”</p>

<p>“Singular!” murmured the doctor meditatively.
Then glancing from the face of his patient to those
of his old friends, “It doesn’t seem to have occurred
to you to wonder how I came here so opportunely
to-night,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Why no, to be sure,” said Mr. Heywood. “How
was it? We have been so taken up with this poor
creature’s critical condition as to have no thought
for anything else.”</p>

<p>“Just so. Well, I was hurrying home from the
bedside of a patient some two miles from here;
very anxious to get home, too, out of the darkness
and storm; when suddenly it was strongly impressed
upon my mind that I was needed here and ought to
come at once. It was a good half-mile out of my
way, as you know; bad road, too, through the thickest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of the woods, where the wind was blowing down
trees, and one might at any moment fall on and
crush me and my horse; but so strong was the impression
I speak of that I really could not resist.
And there surely was a providence in it,” he
added reverently, “for by to-morrow morning medical
aid would have come too late to give this poor
woman even a chance for life.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” said the old lady; “and in her
coming here also. I shall watch with her through
the night, doctor.”</p>

<p>“And I shall share your vigil,” he replied.</p>

<p>The morning sun rose bright and clear, but its
cheerful light brought no alleviation of the wanderer’s
pain. She lay tossing on her couch unconscious
of all the solicitude felt for her, all the kindness lavished
upon her, now muttering incoherently, now
crying out for “her child, her Ethel, her sweet, darling
baby.”</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast Mr. Heywood went
himself in search of a nurse, and having procured
one, and seen her established by the bedside, he and
Mike again drove over to the depot at Clearfield,
reaching there in time for the morning train. When
they returned Rolfe was with them.</p>

<p>A noble, handsome fellow was Rolfe Heywood,
and though the suffering stranger guest was neither
forgotten nor neglected, “joy crowned the board”
at Sweetbrier upon his return, and the weeks that
followed were full of quiet happiness to himself, parents,
and sister.</p>

<p>He was succeeding well in the new State of his
adoption, and hoped to persuade these dear ones to
join him there at some not very distant day.</p>

<p>He took a benevolent interest in the sick woman,
and rejoiced with the others when the physician pronounced
the crisis of the disease past and the patient
in a fair way to recover.</p>

<p>“She’s come to her full senses now, and there
ain’t no doing anything with her,” announced the
nurse a few days later, looking in at the open door
of the room where the family were at breakfast.
“Not a morsel of food will she take, not a drop of
medicine will she swallow. She just lays there with
her eyes shut, and every once in a while I see a big
tear a-rollin’ down them thin, white cheeks o’ hern.”</p>

<p>She withdrew with the last words, and while finishing
their meal the family held a consultation on
the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>On leaving the table, Mrs. Heywood repaired to
the sick-chamber.</p>

<p>The face resting on the snowy pillows was not
only wan and emaciated, but wore an expression of
deepest melancholy. The eyes were closed, but not
in sleep, as Mrs. Heywood at first thought. Stepping
softly to the bedside, she stood silently gazing
upon her, thinking how sad it was that one so young
and fair should be already weary of life.</p>

<p>“My baby, my baby!” came from the pale lips
in low, heart-broken accents, and tears trembled on
the long silken lashes that lay like dark shadows on
the white cheeks.</p>

<p>“My poor, poor child,” said the old lady, bending
down to press a gentle kiss upon her brow, “do not
despair. Try to get well, and who knows but we shall
be able to find your treasure and restore her to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure,” said the nurse, putting a spoon
to her patient’s lips. “Swallow this that the doctor
left for you, there’s a dear, and then take a little of
this beef-tea, and I’ll warrant you’ll feel a heap
better.”</p>

<p>“No, no, take it away. Let me die in peace,” she
sighed, averting her face, and with her wasted hand
feebly putting the spoon aside.</p>

<p>“I want to die&mdash;I’ve nothing to live for now.”
And great tears rolled down the pale sad face.
“Ah, me! I gave her to them, and they will never,
never give her up! Oh, my darling! my baby!
my little Ethel!” she cried, bursting into hysterical
weeping.</p>

<p>Endearments, persuasions, caresses, reasoning, exhortation
on the duty of doing everything in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
power to preserve the life God has given&mdash;all were
tried by turns, but in vain. She lay there in silent
despair, seeming neither to hear nor heed.</p>

<p>Though nearly as much interested in the suffering
stranger as were his parents and sister, Rolfe had
not ventured into the sick-room, and so had never
yet seen her face; nor had he ever heard her voice
or learned her name, of which last, indeed, they
were all ignorant.</p>

<p>Something was taking him to his own apartments
that evening on leaving the tea-table, when he met
Mrs. Scott, the nurse, coming down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Do you leave your patient alone?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Never for long. I’m going down to my supper,
and I’ll speak to Miss Ada to come up and take my
place for a bit.”</p>

<p>She had left the door of the sick-room ajar. A
moan caught Rolfe’s ear in passing, then the words,
“Oh, my baby, my baby!” He started violently,
a strange pallor suddenly overspreading his face.
He stood still, intently listening. The words were
repeated; and hastily pushing the door open, he
stepped to the bedside.</p>

<p>“Ethel, Ethel! Can it be? Oh, Ethel, my light,
my life!”</p>

<p>“Rolfe!” she cried, starting up in the bed, with
both hands extended, the large, lustrous eyes full of
joy and amazement.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms, seating himself on the
side of the bed; her head dropped upon his shoulder,
and folding her to his heart, “Yes, it is
Rolfe,” he said. “Oh, Ethel, have I found you
again? Are you mine at last?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she faintly whispered. “But they
told me you were married to another; then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never, never, my darling! I have loved you
always&mdash;you alone. Oh, why did you write so
coldly, rejecting my offered heart and hand, and
telling me that another had won you?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. The strength excitement
had supplied for the moment was gone, and she lay
apparently lifeless in his arms.</p>

<p>With a sharp cry of agony he laid her back upon
her pillow, and began chafing the cold hands and
pressing passionate kisses on the pale lips.</p>

<p>Hearing his cry as she neared the door of the sick-room,
Ada hurried in, full of wonder and alarm.</p>

<p>“Rolfe!” she exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Ada, make haste! Throw up the window to
give her air! Hand me that bottle of ammonia&mdash;quick,
quick! she’s dying! she’s dead! Oh,
Ethel, my life, my love! have I found you only
to lose you again?” he groaned, redoubling his
efforts to restore her to consciousness, while Ada,
divided between amazement at his presence there
and excessive agitation, and her fear that life was
really extinct, hastily obeyed his orders.</p>

<p>“Thank God, she yet lives!” he said in tones
tremulous with emotion, as at length the eyelids began
to quiver and a long, sighing breath came from
the white lips.</p>

<p>“Rolfe,” they whispered very low and feebly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I am here, my poor little Ethel,” he
answered, kneeling by her couch and fondly caressing
her hair and cheek. “You will live for me, and
nothing in life shall ever part us again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>A beautiful smile crept over her face as she opened
her eyes for a single instant; then closing them
again, she fell asleep with her hand in his.</p>

<p>Ada stood on the farther side of the bed, looking
and listening in increasing surprise and wonder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood and the nurse stole in on tiptoe
and beheld the scene in no less astonishment and
perplexity, but Rolfe motioned them all away, and
kept guard over the slumbers of the invalid as one
who had a superior and undoubted right.</p>

<p>She slept quietly, awoke refreshed, and refused
neither food nor medicine at his hands.</p>

<p>But he would not let her talk.</p>

<p>“Wait, my Ethel, till you are stronger,” he said,
“and then we will tell each other all. In the mean
time we may rest content in the knowledge that we
are restored to each other, and no earthly power can
part us.”</p>

<p>Lips and eyes smiled brightly, and a faint color
stole into her cheek, but faded again as she moaned
sadly, “My baby, my baby!” the tears stealing
down her face.</p>

<p>“We will find her; she shall be restored to you.
Nothing is impossible to a determined will,” he said
with energy.</p>

<p>She believed him, and once more resigned herself
to peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>It was now near midnight, yet a bright light
burned in the sitting-room. Mr. and Mrs. Heywood
and their daughter, too much excited to think
of retiring, sat there waiting for they scarce knew
what. Reluctantly leaving Ethel to the care of the
nurse, Rolfe joined them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, in answer to their inquiring looks,
“we knew and loved each other years ago in Jefferson,
where I first set up business. She was an
orphan, and the sweetest creature I ever saw, but
very much under the influence of an older sister&mdash;a
proud, selfish, scheming, domineering woman.
She, I have always thought it was, who came between
my love and me. I meant to speak before I
left, and tried to do so, but she contrived to foil
every attempt. Then I wrote, and the answer was, I
have little doubt, dictated or forged by her.”</p>

<p>“She rejected you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood’s tone was both inquiring and indignant.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; but don’t condemn her unheard,”
he said, with a smile of filial affection. “That in so
doing she did not follow the dictates of her own
heart I now know beyond a question.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be uncharitable, or to wound
you, Rolfe,” returned his mother, flushing slightly,
“but that any woman should reject the man she
loves and marry another seems to me both weak and
wicked.”</p>

<p>“Wait, my dear, till you have heard her story,”
said the old gentleman. “We don’t know how she
may have been deceived and betrayed.”</p>

<p>A few days later Rolfe came to his mother with an
explanation which even in her eyes exculpated Ethel.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, poor thing! she’s had a hard time of
it,” said the old lady, wiping away a tear. “And
I hope, Rolfe, if she falls into your hands you’ll try
to make it up to her.”</p>

<p>“I shall indeed,” he said, with a peculiar and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
happy smile. “Come, mother, come to her room
with me. The minister is there, my father and
Ada too, and Ethel and I are now to be made one
for life.”</p>

<p>“Rolfe!” she cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; I cannot let her feel herself alone
in the wide world any longer, and I must have the
right to nurse her back to health. You will not
withhold your consent, mother dear?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, with a half-bewildered look as
she accepted the support of his offered arm, “not if
it is to make you and that poor young thing happy;
but it is very sudden.”</p>

</div>

<p>For a few days the little Ethel was quite inconsolable,
crying sadly for “Mamma;” but the new
parents were very tender, patient, and affectionate,
and the old love gradually faded from the baby
memory, till at length it was utterly forgotten in the
new. So also was the name her true mother had
given her, Mrs. Kemper changing it to Florence,
which she liked better.</p>

<p>Anxious that the child should believe herself their
own by birth, the Kempers considered it fortunate
that it was while journeying to a new home in the
West, among strangers, in the little town of Cranley,
that they obtained possession of her.</p>

<p>They breathed no hint of the little one’s history,
and none of their new acquaintances had the least suspicion
of the truth, as indeed how should they when
to both parents “our little Floy” was evidently as
the apple of the eye?</p>

<p>So loved and cared for, and blessed with a sweet,
generous, affectionate disposition, hers was a bright,
sunny childhood. She was spared even the loneliness
of many an only child, finding companion, playmate,
and friend in the little son of the nearest neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The grounds of the Aldens and Kempers adjoined,
and immediately upon the arrival of the latter,
friendly relations were established between the two
families. Mrs. Alden called upon her new neighbors,
taking with her her five-year-old Espy, a flaxen-haired,
blue-eyed boy, who straightway fell in love
with the lustrous, laughing brown orbs and dark
curls of baby Floy.</p>

<p>She sat on a cushion by the side of her new
mamma, daintily habited in white, a gold chain
about her neck, knots of blue ribbon at her shoulders,
and a wide sash of the same at her waist. The plump
little arms hugged close to her bosom a doll half as
large as herself, while the sweet baby voice sang
cheerily, “Bye, baby, bye!”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Espy, regarding her
with admiring eyes.</p>

<p>“Florence,” answered Mrs. Kemper quickly, “but
we call her Floy for short.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty name, and you’re a pretty baby,”
he said, giving her a kiss. “Nex’ time I come I’ll
bring my kitten. She’s a nice cat, and I love her;
but I’ll just give her to you, if you want her.”</p>

<p>“I was never more surprised,” remarked Mrs.
Alden in an aside to Mrs. Kemper. “He prizes that
kitten above all his other possessions.”</p>

<p>And thus it ever was from that first moment. Nothing
could be, in Espy’s esteem, too good, beautiful,
or precious to be given to Floy&mdash;“his little wife,” as
he began to call her before she was three years old,
challenging a special proprietorship in her with
which no other boy was allowed to interfere.</p>

<p>A day seldom passed in which he did not present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
some offering at her shrine, though it were no more
than a sweet-scented clover-blossom or a brightly-tinted
autumn leaf.</p>

<p>They shared each other’s joys and sorrows: all her
little griefs were confided to him; to her he recounted
all his boyish dreams of future achievement when
he should arrive at man’s estate.</p>

<p>He was a born artist, and found in Floy his chief
inspiration; for while his parents and older brothers
and sisters laughed at and discouraged him, she believed
thoroughly in him, and was sure he would
some day be a Rubens, a Raphael, a Michael Angelo,
or something even greater than any of them or all
put together; and her graceful little figure and winsome
face furnished him with a model that he was
never weary of copying.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden, hoping that this son would embrace one
of the learned professions, determined to give him a
liberal education; and the first great grief either
Floy or Espy had known was the parting when the
latter went away to school. Yet there was compensation
in a steady correspondence, kept up with the
knowledge and approval of their parents, and in
the joy of the reunion when vacation brought Espy
home again.</p>

<p>Cranley could boast of a good school for girls,
and Floy did not go from home for her education.
At seventeen she was a very pretty, engaging girl,
and as Mr. Kemper had prospered, and was known
to be in easy circumstances, she had plenty of admirers;
but she remained true to Espy, though theirs
was as yet only a tacit engagement.</p>

<p>Floy graduated from school in June of that year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and Mr. Kemper took her and his wife on a summer
trip to the East. They spent several weeks at the sea-shore,
visited Philadelphia and New York and other
places of interest, then turned homeward.</p>

<p>All had gone well with them, and now within a
few miles of Cranley they were speaking of this
gladly, thankfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ve had a delightful time,” said Floy,
“and yet I am eager to be in our own dear home
again. There is no place like home when it is as
happy a one as ours.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemper smiled indulgently upon her.</p>

<p>“Quite right, my little girl,” he said, “and our
Floy makes half its brightness to us. Is not that so,
mamma?” addressing his wife.</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” she answered, half sighing as the
thought suggested itself that, some day, another
would have a stronger claim than they upon this
darling of her heart.</p>

<p>The whistle blew, the train slackened its speed,
then came to a stand-still at a little country station.</p>

<p>“Peaches! apples! pears!”</p>

<p>A boy had come in with a basket of fruit on his arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemper bought liberally of him; then selecting
a gold half-eagle from the contents of his purse,
he dropped it into Floy’s hand, saying, “There’s a
trifle for you. I wonder how long it will be before
you spend it.”</p>

<p>“A good while, papa, if you keep me in greenbacks
enough to supply my wants,” she returned
gayly, as she deposited it in a dainty portemonnaie.
“Thanks for the gift; I’ll be sure to think of you
when I look at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better put it in bank along with the rest; there’s
five hundred dollars there now to your credit.”</p>

<p>“Then I can afford to keep this to look at.”</p>

<p>The smile died on her lips almost before the words
left them.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong with the engine,” a voice
was saying behind her. “Nobody knows how long
we’ll have to stop here, and we’re not up to time by
half an hour. Hark! what’s that? Another train
coming! we shall be run into!”</p>

<p>Faces paled with sudden fear; men and women
started to their feet in wild affright. There was a
shrill whistle, answered by another, a rush and roar,
then a crash, many voices blending in an awful cry,
and Floy knew no more till, waking as from a deep
sleep, she felt herself gently lifted, while a strange
voice said:</p>

<p>“She’s only stunned; not much hurt, I hope. But
this other woman is horribly mangled, and the man&mdash;well,
his pains are over for this life at least.”</p>

<p>Instantly restored to perfect consciousness, Floy
opened her eyes with a cry, “Mother! father! oh,
where are they? Let me go to them!”</p>

<p>The men set her down on a fragment of the wreck,
and turned to help those in greater need.</p>

<p>The girl passed her hand over her eyes as if to
clear her vision. Oh, was it not all a horrible dream?
The heaped-up ruins, the bleeding, mangled forms of
the dead and dying, the shrieks, the groans, the cries
for help, the running to and fro of those who were
trying to give it, the frenzied search for missing
loved ones, the wail of anguish over the wounded
and the slain!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>What was that they were bearing past her? Could
that be her mother’s voice asking in quivering, agonized
tones for husband and child?</p>

<p>She sprang up and ran after the rude litter on
which the crushed and bleeding form was borne
along toward a farm-house a few rods distant. She
caught sight of the face, white with the pallor of
death and convulsed with pain. A gleam of joy shot
over it as the eyes fell on the face and figure of
Floy. “My darling! safe, thank God!” came from
the pale, quivering lips.</p>

<p>“Mother, mother!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>“Be comforted, darling; I can bear it; ’twill not
be for long,” gasped the sufferer.</p>

<p>They carried her into the house and laid her on a
bed. Floy knelt by her side, grasping the dear hand
in hers, laying it to her cheek, pressing it to her lips,
passionately weeping with a grief that seemed to
rend her heart asunder.</p>

<p>“Floy, dearest, it is all right. God’s will be done.
He knows best. He will comfort you.”</p>

<p>The quick ear of the girl scarcely caught the low-breathed
words, and with the last Mrs. Kemper
fainted.</p>

<p>At the same moment a gentleman came hastily in
and stepped to the bedside.</p>

<p>Instinctively Floy comprehended his errand, even
ere he laid his finger on the pulse or raised the
shawl that half concealed the shattered form.</p>

<p>She rose, outwardly calm and collected.</p>

<p>“Can my mother live?” she asked.</p>

<p>“For some hours,” he said, looking pityingly into
the grief-stricken face of his questioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is she hurt?”</p>

<p>“Poor child! how shall I tell you? Her lower limbs
are completely crushed, and even amputation would
not save her life.”</p>

<p>Floy caught at the bedstead for support, a low cry
of heart-breaking anguish bursting from her lips.
“Oh, mother, mother! And my father!” she gasped,
“oh, where is he?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman who occupied the same seat with
this lady? Ah, my dear child, he is done with
pain.”</p>

<p>The girl sank upon her knees again, hiding her
face in her hands and trembling in every fibre. So
sudden, so terrible were these successive blows that
the very earth seemed slipping from beneath her feet.</p>

<p>“Dear Lord, her heart is overwhelmed; lead her to
the Rock that is higher than she.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken by an old woman in
homely attire who was assisting the physician in
his efforts to restore Mrs. Kemper to consciousness.
The tones were very tender and pitiful, and the
aged hand rested lightly for an instant upon the
bowed head.</p>

<p>“Oh, could not <em>one</em> have been spared to me?”
cried Floy in a burst of agony. “Fatherless! motherless!
oh, that I too had been taken!”</p>

<p>“Dear child, He will be your Father and your
Friend, and life will grow sweet again, and now He
knows and feels for all your pain.”</p>

<p>A groan of agonizing pain came from the crushed
form on the bed.</p>

<p>Floy rose and bent over her, the hot tears falling
like rain upon the pallid, death-like face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother, mother! how can I bear to see you
suffer so?”</p>

<p>The white, quivering lips tried to wreathe themselves
into a smile, and the anguished eyes looked
tenderly into hers.</p>

<p>“Beloved child, it will&mdash;soon&mdash;be over, and I&mdash;shall
be at home&mdash;indeed.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the doctor’s face. “How
long&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A very few hours at the most.”</p>

<p>“Then leave me alone with my child,” she said,
speaking in a stronger voice than before.</p>

<p>The physician gave Floy some directions in regard
to the administering of restoratives, and he and his
assistant withdrew.</p>

<p>Left alone together, hand clasped in hand, mother
and daughter gazed tenderly, mournfully into each
other’s eyes, silent tears trickling down the cheeks of
both. Then gathering up all her failing energies for
the task, Mrs. Kemper told Floy in a few brief sentences
the story of her adoption and all they had
heard from her true mother’s lips in the little shanty
inn at Clearfield Station.</p>

<p>Some things she said which, though they fell
almost unheeded upon Floy’s ears at the time, afterward,
when she had come to care for that unknown
mother, were a great comfort. It was pleasant to
have learned from the dear dying voice that she who
gave her being was unmistakably a lady by birth
and breeding, whom even a stranger recognized as
gentle and lovable.</p>

<p>“I have never been able to remember without
a pang of regret and remorse her agony of grief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
parting from you,” said Mrs. Kemper. “We have
never heard from her, and I think she must have
died soon after, for she seemed then in an almost
dying condition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then why tell me of her? why, dearest,
darling mother, rob me of the belief that I am your
own child&mdash;yours and father’s?” sobbed the heart-broken
girl.</p>

<p>The dying eyes looked into hers with yearning
tenderness.</p>

<p>“Precious one,” she whispered faintly, for her
strength was waning, “I would spare you every unneeded
pang. But,” she went on with frequent
pauses for breath, “the knowledge may some day
be of use to you. You may find relatives, my poor,
lonely darling. You will find the deed of gift among
your father’s papers; your mother’s name is signed
to it. There is a will, my husband told me, leaving
everything to you and me, all to be yours at my
death; so, my&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, darling mother, what do I care for
that now&mdash;now when I have lost my father, and
you too are going from me!” cried the girl in an
agony of grief.</p>

<p>“Nothing now, I know,” the mother said with
pitying tenderness, “but I am glad my darling will
not be left penniless; it would be hard for you to
earn your own bread. And the dear home, Floy,
will be yours.”</p>

<p>Her eyes closed, but the lips still moved, and Floy,
bending over her, caught the broken, faintly murmured
words, “Home&mdash;many mansions&mdash;my Father’s
house&mdash;” Then all was stillness and silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother, oh, mother! speak to me once more!”
cried the girl, pressing passionate kisses on the pale
brow where the dews of death already gathered.
“Is it well with you, darling mother? No fear?
No doubt, no darkness?”</p>

<p>A beautiful smile played about the dying lips, and
again a faint murmur reached the daughter’s intently
listening ear: “All is peace&mdash;peace&mdash;the sweetest
peace; I know that my Redeemer liveth. Trust
Him, trust Him; He will&mdash;never&mdash;leave you.”</p>

<p>A gentle sigh, and Floy knew that she was alone.
No wail of sorrow broke the deep hush of that death-chamber,
no tears fell from the burning eyes of the
solitary mourner. They found her with the still
form clasped in her arms, her dead mother’s head
pillowed upon her bosom, the tearless eyes gazing
with mingled love and anguish upon the calm, sweet
face on whose unruffled brow Peace had set its
signet. The lovely smile yet lingered about the pale
lips which to Floy’s ear seemed ever whispering,
“All is peace, peace, the sweetest peace.”</p>

<p>“Floy!”</p>

<p>Only a word, yet what a world of love and tender
sympathy spoke in the tone and in the touch of the
hand that gently caressed her hair.</p>

<p>The girl started and looked up.</p>

<p>“Oh, Espy!”</p>

<p>Her cheek dropped again upon the head resting
on her bosom, and now the blessed tears came in a
flood.</p>

<p>Espy, just returning from college, had been
scarcely an hour at home when the news came flashing
over the wires that about five miles away a terrible
railroad accident had occurred, in which several
prominent citizens of Cranley, among whom were
the Kempers, had been killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Nearly frantic with fear for Floy, Espy rushed to
the depot, and learning that a special train would be
sent immediately to carry aid to the sufferers, hurried
home again with the tidings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden had already packed a basket with such
things as she thought might be needed, tied on her
hat, and, with a shawl on her arm, stood in the doorway
anxiously looking for her son’s return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>He came running, caught up the basket, and, giving
her his arm, began to retrace his steps, merely
saying in a voice hoarse with emotion, “We must
make all haste, mother, or we’ll be left.”</p>

<p>“Floy?” she cried pantingly, as they almost flew
over the ground. “Oh, I don’t know!” he gasped,
“there are a thousand reports.”</p>

<p>It was only on reaching the scene of the disaster
that they learned who, of all their friends, had been
killed or injured. What a relief to know that Floy
was not of the number! But ah, was she unhurt,
with that crushed and almost broken heart?</p>

<p>They found her as we have described. They
shared her grief, for they had both become strongly
attached to those whose sudden, untimely, and terrible
death she mourned.</p>

<p>“Thank God for those tears!” sobbed Mrs. Alden.
“Dear child, our loss is her gain; and she
has gone to be with the husband she loved so well.
The Lord was good to both in letting them go together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” whispered Floy, laying her precious burden
gently down.</p>

<p>Wiping away her tears, she pressed one more long,
lingering kiss upon the pale lips, then turned, and
giving her hand to Espy, suffered him to lead her
from the room.</p>

<p>Truly the girl’s heart was overwhelmed. Her
adopted father&mdash;whom, until within the last hour,
she had deemed in very truth her own&mdash;was only
less dear than his wife, and the double bereavement,
so sudden, so terrible, was enough to crush her
young spirit to the earth; and yet was there an added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
depth of anguish in the thought of the strange
revelation made to her by that beloved dying voice.</p>

<p>It seemed to rob her of the full right to the poor
luxury of grief. Others also were nearer by the ties
of blood; yet oh, it could not be that any other
loved them with half the strength of devotion that
filled her heart, that any could mourn for them as
she who for sixteen years had been enshrined in
their affections, and lived continually in the sunshine
of their love!</p>

<p>She could not bear to tell this sorrow to any
earthly creature; not even Espy must know the sad
secret. There was only One into whose ear she could
pour out <em>all</em> her griefs. That she could tell Him all
and know that He listened&mdash;that in all her afflictions
He was afflicted&mdash;saved the poor heart from breaking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kemper had been an only child; Mr. Kemper
had outlived his brothers and sisters; so that there
were no nearer relatives than nephews and nieces, all
of whom resided at a great distance. Word was
sent to those whose addresses were known, but they
were not waited for, as it was impossible they should
arrive in time for the funeral.</p>

<p>The Aldens were very kind, treating Floy quite as
if she belonged to them, and relieving her of every
care in regard to the necessary arrangements for performing
the last offices of love to the departed.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the day on which she had
looked for the last time upon the dear faces of the
loved and lost. At her own request sympathizing
friends had all withdrawn and left her alone, and Espy,
coming softly into the parlor unannounced, found her
weeping bitterly before Mrs. Kemper’s portrait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Floy, dearest Floy, my own little wife, would
that I could comfort you!” he whispered, taking her
in his arms.</p>

<p>“You have been&mdash;you are a great comfort to me,
Espy,” she said, gently releasing herself.</p>

<p>“Then why may I not embrace you, dear Floy?
Ah, I understand! it is because there has never
been a formal engagement between us. But we
know we love and belong to each other. Is it not
so? Darling Floy, promise to be my wife.”</p>

<p>She answered with a look that made his heart
bound.</p>

<p>“You are all I have now, Espy,” she sobbed, allowing
him to draw her head to a resting-place on his
shoulder; “all I have to love or to give love to me.”</p>

<p>“I wish you knew how much I love you, Floy, my
poor stricken one, and how I long to comfort you!”
he whispered, clasping her close with many a tender
caress.</p>

<p>“The cloud is very, very black!” she sighed. “Oh,
it seems as if my heart will break! The blow has been
so sudden, so terrible&mdash;I cannot fully realize it yet.
I am stunned. I seem to be living in a dream&mdash;a horrible
dream; a dreadful nightmare is upon me,” she
moaned. “Oh, Espy, wake me and tell me the dear
father and mother, alive and well yesterday, are not
now lying in the cold grave!” and she shuddered
and hid her face, while choking sobs shook her from
head to foot.</p>

<p>“They are not there; they are beyond the stars, in
the region of unclouded light, dear Floy,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is true! and oh, thank God that
you are left me still!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>No one intruded upon them, and they parted only
when it was time for Floy to retire.</p>

<p>Worn out with grief and the fatigue of her journey,
she fell asleep the moment her head touched the
pillow.</p>

<p>The sun was up when she woke again, birds were
singing in the tree close to her window, and the glad
voices of children at play on the other side of the
street came pleasantly to her ear. Had she escaped
from her horrible nightmare?</p>

<p>Alas! for only an instant; it was upon her again.
Bitter tears coursed down her cheeks. How lonely
and desolate was her lot! but ah, Espy’s love was
left her still. There was balm for her wounded spirit
in that thought.</p>

<p>Then came another&mdash;the secret imparted with Mrs.
Kemper’s dying breath. Had not Espy now a right
to know the truth as well as she?</p>

<p>She pondered the question for a moment. She was
sure it would make no difference in his love, as why
should it indeed? But he should know; she would
have no concealments from him who was to be her
second self.</p>

<p>And, after all, how little there was to tell! What
did she know beyond the bare fact that she was the
child of her reputed parents only by adoption?</p>

<p>Ah, the paper, the deed of gift her mother had
spoken of&mdash;she must find it; it would at least tell
her her true name. Oh, what an added grief to
think that she had no right to the one she had borne
since her earliest recollection! and yet, they having
given it to her, had she not a right?</p>

<p>On leaving the breakfast-table, where she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
gone through the form of taking her morning meal,
she went directly to the room where Mr. Kemper’s
books and papers were kept, and began her search,
at first with confident expectation, though in trembling,
eager haste, then anxiously, and at length in
sadness akin to despair. She had examined one receptacle
after another, till all had been gone over
without coming upon the object of her quest. A leaf
torn from a note-book&mdash;it must be a small paper,
easily overlooked; and with that thought in her
mind she began her exploration anew. She had not
given it up yet when the servant-girl came to say
that Mr. Alden was in the parlor.</p>

<p>Floy repaired thither at once.</p>

<p>It was not Espy, but his father, who came forward
as she entered, took her hand in his and led her to a
sofa, where he seated himself by her side.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” he said, “Espy has told us all,
and we are very glad; though of course it is only
what we had looked forward to as a settled thing for
years past.”</p>

<p>His manner was so paternal and affectionate that
for a moment Floy was too much overcome for
speech, so vividly did it remind her of the father
she had lost.</p>

<p>He understood her emotion, and tried to console
her with the assurance that she need no longer feel
herself orphaned and alone in the world, since he
and his wife would henceforth regard her as their
own child.</p>

<p>Then he went on to speak of the necessity of a settlement
of Mr. Kemper’s estate, asking her whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
there was a will, and who was appointed executor,
adding:</p>

<p>“Your father once expressed a wish that I would
undertake that office for him, at the same time telling
me that his intention was to make a will dividing
his property equally between you and his wife, her
half to revert to you or your heirs at her death; but
the subject was not mentioned between us afterward,
and I do not know anything more about the matter.”</p>

<p>“Mother told me there was a will,” said Floy,
“and it would give me everything. But I do not
know where to find it.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless it is somewhere among his private
papers,” said Mr. Alden; adding reflectively, “It will
be quite a task for you to examine them, and you
should have help. I am very busy just now, but Espy
is entirely at leisure. Shall he come and help you
look them over?”</p>

<p>The young man came in while his father was
speaking, and, on hearing an explanation of the matter,
eagerly seconded the offer. Anything to assist
Floy, especially if it kept him in her dear society.</p>

<p>“I am ready to begin at once, if it suits your convenience
and inclination,” he said to her, and she
answering that it did, his father left them, and they
repaired together to the room where she had been so
busy all the morning.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>There were papers scattered over the table, and
one or two had fallen on the floor.</p>

<p>“You see I had begun the task before your father
came,” Floy said, with a sad smile; “but before we
resume it I have something to say to you,” she added
with an effort, growing so pale that Espy caught
her in his arms, thinking she was about to faint.</p>

<p>“My poor Floy!” he said, “if it is anything painful,
don’t tell it; there is no need.”</p>

<p>“I want you to know it, Espy,” she sighed low
and tremulously, “but to keep it secret from all others
unless&mdash;unless it&mdash;circumstances should render it
necessary that&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her head dropped upon his shoulder, and with a
burst of hysterical weeping, “Oh, Espy, Espy!” she
cried, “I’m more than orphaned; I’ve lost my
identity; I’m not Floy Kemper&mdash;not the child of
the dear parents I mourn, except&mdash;except by adoption!”</p>

<p>He was greatly surprised, but only drew her closer
to him, as one made dearer still by her sore distress,
her utter loneliness; and as she went on in her low,
quivering tones, “I’ve none now but you; I’m all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
alone in the wide world&mdash;not a relative living, so far
as I know,” a strange thrill of joy mingled with his
sympathetic grief&mdash;joy that she was his, his alone to
love and cherish to life’s end; that on him only she
would lean as her earthly stay and support.</p>

<p>Something of this he whispered in reply, accompanying
his words with fond caresses and endearing
epithets.</p>

<p>“How good and noble you are, my Espy!” she
said. “You still hold me to your heart without waiting
to learn who or what I am.”</p>

<p>“You are my own little Floy, whom I have loved
from her very babyhood,” he interrupted, holding
her fast as she made a movement as if to release herself
from his embrace, “and that is all I care to
know.”</p>

<p>She lifted her large, lustrous eyes to his with a
look of grateful love. “No, no, I will not take advantage
of your generous affection,” she said, the
tears streaming down her cheeks. “Wait till I have
told you all&mdash;till you know everything. Till then
I will not hold you bound by&mdash;what passed between
us last night.”</p>

<p>“I will not accept my freedom”&mdash;he began impetuously.
But she stopped him with an imperative
gesture.</p>

<p>“Hear my story.” And in a few rapid sentences
she gave him the facts as learned from Mrs. Kemper.</p>

<p>His face brightened as she proceeded.</p>

<p>“What is there in this, Floy, to come between us,
or even to raise an objection to our union in the
mind of the most captious?” he asked. “You were
born in wedlock, your mother was a lady, and presumably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
your father a gentleman. Besides, there is
absolutely no need that any one but our own two
selves should ever learn these facts. You are known
as the child of Mr. and Mrs. Kemper, and that you
are not, concerns us alone.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; and now let us look for the will.”</p>

<p>“The will!” A sudden painful thought had
flashed upon her. Espy saw it in her face.</p>

<p>“Well, dearest, what is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If we should not find it?”</p>

<p>Her voice was low and husky.</p>

<p>“Then we shall do the best we can without it,” he
answered cheerily, turning to the table and taking
up a roll of papers tied together with a bit of red
tape. “Have you looked at this?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes, but only with care enough to make
sure that the deed of gift was not among them. But
the will&mdash;if it is not found, does not the law give
everything to father’s relatives? and will not that
make this&mdash;this secret of mine public?” she asked,
speaking with difficulty, as if the subject were almost
too painful for discussion.</p>

<p>Espy started, and dropped the packet upon the
floor; but recovering himself, stooped to pick it up,
saying with determination:</p>

<p>“But we <em>will</em> find it; of course it must be here or
somewhere about the house. Cheer up, Floy dear,
and let us go to work.”</p>

<p>They spent the greater part of three days at their
task. Every paper was unfolded, shaken out, examined
and re-examined, every nook and corner diligently
ransacked, and thorough but unavailing search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
made for secret drawers, yet neither will nor deed of
gift could be found.</p>

<p>At last they were forced to the conclusion that the
deed of gift was irrecoverably lost; the will also, if
it had ever existed, which seemed very doubtful.</p>

<p>“Ah, what success to-day?” asked the elder Mr.
Alden, coming in upon them as they were slowly replacing
the papers in the secretary, almost hoping,
even against hope, to yet come upon the missing papers.</p>

<p>“None, sir,” answered Espy.</p>

<p>“What! no will? Surely you must have overlooked
it. Mrs. Kemper you say, Floy, told you
there was one&mdash;just such as Mr. Kemper had told
me he purposed making&mdash;and he could have no motive
for concealing it. Let me think; possibly he
may have carried it on his person. Have you examined
the pockets of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Espy, starting up with animation.
“Floy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot!” she groaned, hiding her face.</p>

<p>“No, no, assuredly not; forgive me, darling,” he
whispered, bending over her; “but may I?”</p>

<p>She gave a silent assent, and he and his father left
the room.</p>

<p>In a few moments they returned, Espy carrying a
large-sized pocket-book, old and worn, which he
placed in Floy’s hands, saying, “This is all we
found. It is for you to open and examine it.”</p>

<p>She did so, her tears dropping over it all the time.
It contained a little change and a few papers of no
great importance&mdash;receipted bills, memoranda, etc.</p>

<p>“It is not here; he never made it,” she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
huskily, pushing the book and its contents from
her. “Ah, father, father, what has your neglect cost
me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so distressed, child; there is really no
occasion,” said Mr. Alden soothingly. “I don’t
know why, as I told Espy yesterday, you and he have
taken so much trouble to hunt for the will, as, you
being the only child, the law gives all to you in case
your father died intestate, as it seems he did.”</p>

<p>She lifted her white face, which she had hidden in
her hands; she would not see Espy’s imploring look.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Alden, you mistake,” she said; “I,
lacking the will, am not the heir.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear child! ’Tis you who are mistaken.
Why, how could you doubt that you, his
only child, inherit Mr. Kemper’s property by natural
right, unless he chose to will it, or part of it, to
some one else?”</p>

<p>She seemed shaken with contending emotions; but
controlling herself by a strong effort, and looking
with steady, mournful gaze into the eyes of him
whom she addressed, “I thought&mdash;I believed&mdash;oh, I
never <em>doubted</em> till the hour that I became doubly
orphaned&mdash;that I was his own child and&mdash;and hers!”</p>

<p>She paused for an instant, with her hands tightly
clasped over her heart, then went on in lower and
more tremulous tones. “But she&mdash;my mother&mdash;as I
must call her still&mdash;she told me with her dying breath
that&mdash;that I was theirs only by adoption.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alden, who had been standing, staggered
back and dropped into a chair, looking perfectly astounded.</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;who are you then?” he gasped at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do not know, except&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Floy, my own little wife,” whispered
Espy, throwing a protecting arm about her
and making her lean on him.</p>

<p>Then turning to his father, he stated the facts as
succinctly as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden listened with a grave and troubled air,
and, when his son had finished, sat for some moments
in silent cogitation.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at length, “this is a rather bad
business; and yet&mdash;perhaps not so bad as it looks.
Floy, how many are in this secret&mdash;about your birth,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“Our three selves only,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Good! very good!” he said, rubbing his hands
with a complacent smile. “Your sex is not famed
for ability to keep secrets, but I’ll trust you for this
one.”</p>

<p>She gave him a look of surprised inquiry.</p>

<p>“So long as you are believed to be Mr. Kemper’s
own child,” he went on to explain, “no one will dispute
your right to the property, and it’s very considerable,
Floy&mdash;worth taking some pains to secure.”</p>

<p>Her dark eyes opened wide upon him in half-incredulous,
indignant surprise, but he gave her no
opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>“And it is yours of right, for, as we all know, Mr.
Kemper intended it for you, and you will only be
fulfilling his wishes in retaining possession, which,
as the old saying has it,” he added, with an unpleasant
laugh, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>“is nine points of the law.”</p>

<p>Utter amazement at so base a proposal kept the
girl silent for an instant; then releasing herself from
Espy’s supporting arm, she stood erect before her
tempter, her hands tightly clenched, a crimson tide
rushing over the face so pale but a moment ago, the
great dark eyes flashing with indignant anger, then
filling with tears of deeply wounded feeling.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see; you were not serious. You could not
believe me capable of such a crime. But it was a
cruel jest,” she said in a choking voice, and ending
with a burst of almost hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>“Crime!” echoed Mr. Alden testily. “Girl, you
don’t know what you are talking about! How can
it be a crime to take the property your father accumulated
expressly for you?”</p>

<p>“I beg, sir, that the matter may be allowed to rest
for the present,” interposed Espy; “we have had
a hard day’s work, and Floy is not in a condition,
either mentally or physically, to attend to business.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, just as she pleases; there’s no particular
hurry, and I’d be the last one to want to distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
her,” returned Mr. Alden, and taking up his
hat he stalked out of the room, evidently not over-pleased.
In fact, his ire was roused not a little by
the term Floy had applied to his proposition.</p>

<p>“Crime indeed!” he muttered to himself as he
hurried down the garden path. “As if I&mdash;I could
be thought capable of suggesting a crime!”</p>

<p>He hastened to his wife with his grievance.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind the child; she’s only a slip
of a girl, and I dare say hardly knows what a crime
is,” Mrs. Alden answered soothingly. “But really,
remembering how they doted on her and petted
her, I never was more surprised at anything in my
life than to hear that she wasn’t their own.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, Jane; and if she’s going to be such a fool
as to publish the thing and give up the property that
she knows, and we all know, was intended for her,
why&mdash;I’ll withdraw my consent&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, Nathan, don’t say that!” hastily interrupted
his wife, knowing that he was an obstinate
man and prided himself on keeping his word. “You
might come to wish you hadn’t, for she’s a nice girl,
and we’re all fond of her&mdash;you as well as the rest of
us. There, now, I must go and see about supper,”
she added, making an excuse to leave him before he
had had time to commit himself.</p>

<p>Worn out with grief, excitement, and over-exertion,
Floy went to bed that night with a raging headache,
and for the next two or three days was able to do little
but lie on the sofa.</p>

<p>Espy was with her almost constantly, saving her
as much as possible from every annoyance, and comforting
her with his sympathy and love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not days of mirth and gladness, but of
much heaviness of heart, yet often looked back upon
in after years with tender regret, a mournful sweetness
lingering about their memory.</p>

<p>As by mutual consent both Floy and Espy avoided
the subject of the missing papers and her future action
in regard to the property. It frequently obtruded
itself upon Floy’s thoughts, but she refused
to consider it for the time being; it must wait until
she had strength for the struggle which she foresaw
was before her if she would follow the dictates of an
enlightened conscience.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden grew impatient.</p>

<p>“Espy,” he said at length, “what is Floy going
to do?”</p>

<p>“She has not told me, sir; the subject has not
been mentioned between us.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s high time it was; I hope you’ll talk to
her about it to-day, and try to convince her of the
reasonableness of the course I have recommended.”</p>

<p>“I should rather not undertake it, sir. I am not at
all sure that hers is not the right view of the matter.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, don’t be a fool, Espy!” returned his
father angrily. “You’d be standing amazingly in
your own light, if you mean to marry the girl; it’s a
fine property, and would give you just the start in
life you need. Why, you might give up studying
for a profession and devote yourself at once to your
beloved art,” he added, with an unpleasant laugh.</p>

<p>The young man flushed deeply. “I should despise
myself, sir, if I could act from such motives,”
he said, forcing himself to speak quietly, though the
hot blood coursed through his veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your father doesn’t mean that he wants you to
marry for money, or to do anything dishonest to
get it,” interposed Mrs. Alden. “All he asks is that
you will persuade Floy not to throw away what we
all know was meant for her.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll take back that request,” said the elder
gentleman. “Leave her to me; that’s all I ask.”</p>

<p>“I shall not try to influence her one way or the
other,” said Espy. “But, father, be patient with
her if she can’t see things just as you do. She’s almost
heart-broken already, poor child!”</p>

<p>This conversation had taken place at the breakfast-table,
and immediately on the conclusion of the
meal Espy hastened to Floy to learn how she was in
health, determined to save her from an encounter
with his father until she felt quite equal to it.</p>

<p>He found her free from pain, calm and quiet in
manner, though with an expression of deep sadness
in her large dark eyes and about the lines of her mobile
mouth. She was strangely changed from the
careless, light-hearted creature of a week ago.
Sorrow and bereavement had done the work of years,
and the child of yesterday had become a self-poised,
self-reliant woman.</p>

<p>She had spent some hours that morning in earnest
thought, asking wisdom and strength from Him
who has declared Himself in a peculiar sense the
“Father of the fatherless,” and in searching His
Word for direction; and now her mind was fully
made up.</p>

<p>Espy told her of his father’s intended call, and asked
if she would see him, adding, “Don’t hesitate to decline,
Floy. You can guess his errand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, sighing slightly, “and I cannot
follow his wishes, because it would be doing violence
to my conscience. But I will hear all he has to say.
Ah,” she added, tears filling her eyes, “it is hard to
be compelled to do what vexes and angers those you
love and would fain please rather than yourself!
Espy, will you turn against me?”</p>

<p>“Never, never, my poor child! I will stand by
you through everything.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and the elder Mr. Alden came in.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-morning, my dear child,” he said, taking
Floy’s hand. “Glad to see you about again!
should have been here before, but Espy insisted that
you were better let alone.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said. “Please be seated.”</p>

<p>He was not long in introducing the real object of
his visit, but approached the subject with more caution
than before. He spoke of Mr. Kemper’s great
fondness for her and his fatherly pride in her, and
the determination he had been frequently heard to
express, that if he could prevent it his darling
should never know what it was to want for the comforts
and even luxuries of life.</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Floy, the tears stealing down
her pale cheeks, “father loved me very dearly, and
was always tenderly careful of me.”</p>

<p>“And can you believe that he would want the
property he accumulated to be enjoyed by some one
else, and you left to struggle with poverty?” asked
Mr. Alden.</p>

<p>“No; oh no, no!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” There was a world of meaning in the slight
exclamation. It said, “So you are coming to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
senses at last! you see now that I was right, and
I’m delighted that such is the case.”</p>

<p>“Do not mistake me, Mr. Alden,” said the girl,
sighing. “I am certain father would have preferred
to leave me well provided for, but he may have
finally concluded that it would be more just to leave his
property to those who were related to him by ties of
blood.”</p>

<p>Emotion stopped her utterance; she had not yet
learned to think and speak calmly of the fact that
there was no natural tie between herself and those
who had been as the dearest of parents to her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” was the angry exclamation that
rose to Mr. Alden’s lips; but checking himself, he
said in a tone of mild expostulation, “I am sure, my
dear child, you need not trouble yourself with any
such fears. He made every cent of his money, and
certainly had a perfect right to leave it as he pleased.
And there is not the least doubt in my mind that you
would be following out his wishes in retaining possession
of it. Indeed I think it would be very
wrong as well as foolish to do otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Why wrong?”</p>

<p>“Because it would be disposing of his property as
he would not have wished it to be disposed of.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Alden, suppose you were his next of
kin, would you not see this matter differently?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;possibly our own interests are very apt to
blind us to the rights of others.”</p>

<p>Floy smiled faintly, thinking how nearly akin to a
man’s own interest was that of his son.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “that is human nature; we are
naturally selfish, I as well as others; so much so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
that if I knew the property was lawfully mine I
should never think of giving it away.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is not mine to give or to keep, but must
go to the rightful heirs.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alden bit his lips with vexation, rose and
paced the room for some moments; then, having
recovered control of himself, came and sat down by
Floy.</p>

<p>“I know you want to do right,” he said pleasantly,
“and I have only to convince you that the
course I wish you to take is right to induce you to
take it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you how gladly I should do so,” she
answered.</p>

<p>At this moment Espy, who had taken no part in
the conversation, though a deeply interested listener,
was, much to his discontent, summoned away by a
message from his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden did most of the talking for the next
hour, going over the old arguments again and again,
but bringing forward little that was new except that
Mr. and Mrs. Kemper, in adopting her as their own
child, had given her all the rights of a child, and
therefore, will or no will, she was the proper heir.</p>

<p>“Is that according to the law of the land?” she
asked, a gleam of hope shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>He evaded the question. “Human laws are very
faulty; we need not always be bound by them.”</p>

<p>“No, not when they come in collision with the
higher law of God; but that is not the case in this
instance.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s thought and stroking of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
beard, he began on another tack, speaking of Espy
and his plans, and dwelling at considerable length
upon the great advantage it would be to the young
man if his wife had sufficient means to give him a
start in life.</p>

<p>Floy heard him to the end in unbroken silence,
her hands tightly clasped in her lap, a look of pain
more than once crossing her features, while the color
came and went on her cheek.</p>

<p>He seemed to have finished, but she neither moved
nor spoke.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, rising and taking up his hat
from the table where he had placed it on entering,
“I’ll leave you to think it all over. Good-morning!”</p>

<p>“Stay!” she said, suddenly rising and standing
before him, her hands still clasped, a look of anguish
in her eyes as she lifted them to his, her voice tremulous
with emotion, not from any faltering of purpose.
“I need no further time for deliberation. I
have thought and prayed over this matter, and my
duty has been made very clear to me. Right and
justice must be done, at whatever cost to me or
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>The last word was lost in a bitter, choking sob.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden turned abruptly on his heel and left the
house.</p>

</div>

<p>“What is it, Nathan?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden had come upon her husband pacing
the front porch of their dwelling with angry strides.</p>

<p>“That girl!” he said between his shut teeth. “I
wash my hands of her and her affairs, and Espy shall
never marry her with my consent, mark that, Jane!”
and he brought down his clenched fist with emphasis
upon the open palm of the other hand.</p>

<p>His wife looked disturbed, but after a moment’s
thought said cheerfully, “She’ll come round yet,
Nathan, and you don’t mean that to stand if she
does?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not; but she isn’t going to come
round; she hasn’t the sense to understand and appreciate
an argument, and has somehow got her
head full of Quixotic notions. I suppose she thinks
she’ll make a grand heroine of herself by giving up
everything to Kemper’s relations, and that they’ll
generously hand back a share of it, or maybe the
whole; but she’ll find out when it’s too late that
she’s made a wonderful mistake.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden had her own opinion regarding Floy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>’s
sense, but was far too wise to contradict her husband.</p>

<p>“I haven’t lived with him forty years for nothing,”
she sometimes said. “I’ve found out that the
only way to manage him is to seem to give in to all
his notions. So I never cross him, and I generally
contrive in the end to have things pretty much as I
want them.”</p>

<p>Seeing she made no reply to his remark, Mr.
Alden went on to give her a detailed account of his
interview with Floy, winding up with, “There, now,
what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Poor young thing!” sighed his wife, “it’s really
dreadful to think what she’s gone through in the last
two weeks, and perhaps she couldn’t quite put her
mind on what you were saying so as to take it all in.
Give her a little time; she may come around yet to
your way of thinking. I must go and see about dinner
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered absently. “Suppose you go
over after dinner; coaxing will move a woman sometimes
when argument won’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” she said as she hurried away. It was
what she had intended, though she had not thought
it best to say so.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden’s departure had left Floy alone, for
Espy had not yet returned. Sinking down upon the
sofa, she wept convulsively for some minutes. Presently
she grew calmer, and, wiping away her tears,
rose and went to her father’s writing-desk.</p>

<p>Seating herself before it, she selected a sheet of
note-paper, took up a pen, and was in the act of dipping
it in the ink, when Susan, the maid of all work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
put her head in at the door, saying, “Mr. Crosby’s
in the parlor, Miss Floy, asking to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for coming,” Floy said
when she had shaken hands with her visitor. “I
was just about to write a note asking you to call.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if I can be of service to you,” he
said. “I should have called sooner, but returned
only last night from a pleasure-trip, the first I have
taken in years. Now what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosby, the first lawyer in the place, had been
Mr. Kemper’s legal adviser.</p>

<p>At first Floy seemed unable to speak. She rose,
and motioning Mr. Crosby to follow her, led the way
to the room she had just left. They were closeted
together there for an hour, in which Mr. Crosby
learned the whole story of Mrs. Kemper’s death-bed
revelations, and the unsuccessful search for the deed
of gift and the will.</p>

<p>“I am extremely sorry to hear all this,” he said.
“I was pretty certain there was no will, because Mr.
Kemper had spoken to me about drawing one up for
him, telling me that he intended leaving the bulk of
his property to his wife and daughter, but not going
sufficiently into particulars to enable me to write out
the instrument without further instructions. These
he delayed giving me from time to time, being
always so much occupied with his business. If you
were, as I always believed till now, his own child,
the omission would make little or no difference; but
as it is, it leaves you quite unprovided for. If I
had known the truth I should have urged him
strongly to attend to the matter without delay.
It’s a bad business, a very bad business for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Miss Floy! I feel for you from the bottom of my
heart, and I would do anything in the world I could
to help you.”</p>

<p>“I believe it, Mr. Crosby,” she said with emotion,
“and if you will undertake&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To communicate with the heirs at law? Certainly;
and I shall try to induce them to allow your
claim to a share in the property you have so generously
resigned to them&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not generously, Mr. Crosby,” she interrupted,
“only justly.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, if you will have it so; but Miss
Floy, you might have kept the secret revealed by
your mother locked up in your own breast, and retained
the property without the least danger of interference
from any one. Did you know that?”</p>

<p>She gave a silent assent.</p>

<p>“And even leaving the inheritance of the estate
out of the question, you would have been glad to
keep the secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes; oh, yes!” she said, covering her face with
her hands, while the tears trickled between her fingers.</p>

<p>He looked at her with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“You are a noble girl!” he exclaimed; and rising,
paced the floor to and fro.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried, “the mischief that simple neglect
will do! It has been the ruin of thousands, and
through it men have, in multitudes of instances, frustrated
their own most cherished plans and purposes.
Mr. Kemper schemed and toiled to provide for the
old age of himself and wife, and that he might have
wealth to bestow upon you, the darling of his heart;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and now, through his own omission, it will pass to
others, one or two of whom, I happen to know, are
spendthrifts, who will probably speedily waste their
shares in riotous living. It’s a thousand pities! If
we could but bring proof of your formal adoption,
making you his legal heir&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is none,” she sighed, “and perhaps they
are very needy&mdash;those heirs&mdash;and may do better with
this than you expect, Mr. Crosby. We will not
blame poor dear father. How ungrateful it would
be in me to do so after all that he and mother did for
me&mdash;after all the love and care they bestowed on me
for so many years! I had not the slightest claim on
them, yet they clothed, fed, educated me&mdash;made my
childhood and youth so bright and happy. Oh,
never did poor little waif fall into hands so kind and
tender!”</p>

<p>“Your sentiments do you honor, Miss Floy,” said
Mr. Crosby, “and now I will return to my office and
attend to this matter at once. I shall write the heirs,
letting them know how entirely they are indebted to
you for this accession of property, and urge upon
them the justice of allowing you a share in it.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with her, said a few encouraging,
hopeful words, and departed.</p>

<p>“Glad he’s gone at last,” said Susan, putting her
head in at the door again. “Thought he never would
go, and your dinner is drying up over the fire till
’tain’t hardly fit to eat. Come, Miss Floy, I’ll have
it on the table by the time you can get out to the
dining-room.”</p>

<p>Floy brought little appetite to her meal, and ate
mechanically, scarcely knowing what the viands were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>She had just risen from the table when Mrs. Alden
came in. Floy flushed slightly on seeing her. She
knew that Mr. Alden had gone away very angry, and
was doubtful how far his wife would be in sympathy
with him.</p>

<p>But the greeting of the latter was kind and motherly
as usual.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad the poor head is better again,” she
said, kissing the girl affectionately. “You must forgive
me for calling Espy away this morning. I had
to get him to drive out to the country for butter and
eggs, for there were none to be had in town, and I’d
nobody else to send. He hasn’t got back yet, or you
may be sure he’d have been in again.”</p>

<p>Talking on, with hardly a pause for a reply, Mrs.
Alden gradually approached the subject of the morning’s
conversation between her husband and Floy.</p>

<p>“I honor you for your intentions, my dear,” she
said. “I know they are altogether good and right,
but you’re very young and inexperienced, and I
think have a morbid conscientiousness that blinds
you to your own interests, and, if you’ll allow me to
say it, to Espy’s too, because if you’re going to be
man and wife you can’t have separate interests.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Alden,” said Floy, with a patient
sigh, “you cannot surely think it is ever right to do
evil that good may come, or that ill-gotten wealth
will be of real benefit to its possessor?”</p>

<p>“No, child, certainly not,” she answered with
some annoyance, “but those questions don’t apply
in this case. You needn’t be afraid that anything
my husband does or advises could be wrong, because
he’s too good a man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>It probably did not occur to the loyal wife that she
was reversing the Bible test&mdash;judging of the fruit by
the tree, instead of the tree by its fruit.</p>

<p>“I do not think he would do or advise anything
that he thought wrong,” returned Floy gently;
“but you know each of us must act according to his
or her own conscience, and mine absolutely refuses
to see this matter as Mr. Alden does.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mostly let him judge for me,” said Mrs.
Alden. “I find it’s the only way to have peace, and
I can’t live in a constant broil; not that he’s particularly
ill-natured, but he naturally thinks he ought
to be master in his own house. Another thing,
Floy: if he once sets his foot down there’s no getting
him to lift it again, and he vows that if you persist in
giving up this property Espy shall never marry you
with his consent. So, you see if you can’t be persuaded
there’ll be endless trouble for us all.”</p>

<p>Floy’s cheek crimsoned and her eye flashed, while
the pretty head was thrown haughtily back as she
drew herself up with an air of wounded pride.</p>

<p>“It was your son who sought me, Mrs. Alden, not
I him; nor shall I ever thrust myself into a family
where I am not wanted and should be made an element
of discord.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden was thoroughly dismayed.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” she hastened to say, “I did not
mean to hurt your feelings, and I can’t bear the
thought of losing you. But Espy will never give
you up; he’d break with his father and all of us
first, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He can’t marry me against my will,” interrupted
Floy; “so pray dismiss all anxiety on that score. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
would no more rob you and Mr. Alden of your son
than&mdash;than I would steal the inheritance of the heirs
at law of this property.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Floy, Floy, to make you break with Espy is
the very last thing I intended; don’t do it; he’d
never forgive me; but oh! if I only could persuade
you to keep this secret of your birth and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is already too late,” answered the girl in a
low, quiet tone, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>“the deed is done.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“What shall I do? what <em>shall</em> I do?” Mrs. Alden
asked herself again and again as, in great perturbation
of spirit, she awaited Espy’s return. “How
angry and distressed he’ll be, poor boy!”</p>

<p>She was at a loss to determine whether it would
be best to break the news to him herself, or to let
him hear it first from Floy or his father.</p>

<p>But circumstances decided for her. As she sat
at the window watching the lengthening shadows as
the sun drew near his setting, and saying to herself
that Espy was very late&mdash;it was nearly tea-time, and
she almost began to fear that he had met with some
accident&mdash;she heard the gate swing, and turning
her head saw him coming up the gravel walk that
led from it to the house.</p>

<p>He moved with rapid strides, and there was an
angry flush on his cheek, an indignant light in his
eye, which told her at once that he had already been
made aware of the unfortunate turn affairs had
taken.</p>

<p>In a moment more he stood before her with folded
arms, firmly-set mouth, and stern eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Espy, my son! Oh, I am so sorry!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” he said, “my father and I have
had a quarrel; he called me into his office as I
passed, and ordered me to give up all thoughts of
Floy&mdash;my little Floy that I’ve loved from my very
infancy!”</p>

<p>“And what did you say, Espy?” she asked tremulously,
feeling as if the very unreasonableness and
tyranny of the command must have of itself almost
deprived him of the power of speech.</p>

<p>“Say, mother? that he might as well ask me to
shoot myself through the heart, and that I’d never
give her up; I’d die first.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but, Espy, what&mdash;what if she gives you up?”
gasped his mother, fairly frightened by his vehemence.</p>

<p>He staggered back as if struck by a heavy blow,
while a deathly pallor overspread his face for an instant.</p>

<p>“But she will not!” he said hoarsely; “she has
pledged herself to me, and she’ll never prove false to
her word.”</p>

<p>“But she is very proud, Espy&mdash;too proud, I think,
to come into a family where she’s not wanted; and
she’s a good girl, and will see that it’s your duty
to obey your father.”</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair, and for a moment seemed
lost in thought; then with a sigh, “My father may
have a right to control me even in this while I am
a minor; but, as you know, mother, in six months
I shall have reached my majority, and then I’ll
be my own master, and shall consider that in a
matter which will affect my happiness so much more
nearly than his, and probably for my whole life, I
have a right to follow my own wishes. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
there is Floy’s happiness to be taken into account.
She says she loves me; we’ve pledged
ourselves to each other, my father consenting to it
at the time&mdash;and could he ask me to play so base a
part as to forsake the dear girl merely because she
has become poor and friendless? I think even he
would despise me if I could be guilty of such meanness;
and most assuredly I should despise myself!”</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet with the last sentence,
and now, as he stood erect before her, with kindling
eye and glowing cheek, he looked so noble and
manly that his mother’s heart swelled with pride in
her son.</p>

<p>“No, you’ll never do anything mean or dishonorable,
Espy,” she said, smiling up at him.</p>

<p>Then growing suddenly grave, and an anxious,
troubled look stealing over her face at the recollection
of her husband’s anger, which she knew must have
waxed hot at his son’s resistance to his demand:
“But there’ll be no peace between your father and
you if you go against his will; so if Floy chooses
to break the engagement herself, you needn’t feel
called upon to try to hold her to it.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, “you are keeping something
back; tell me all. You have spoken to her&mdash;told
her what father says?”</p>

<p>His eyes were gazing steadily into hers, and there
was a mingling of grief and suppressed wrath that
made her fear to answer him. She hesitated, then
said hastily:</p>

<p>“You’d better go to her. She can tell you what
she likes.”</p>

<p>He turned without a word, caught up his hat, and
went.</p>

<span class="sub_head">FLOY’S RESOLVE.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-head">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“A beam of comfort, like the moon through clouds,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Gilds the black horror, and directs my way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Pride&mdash;her woman’s pride&mdash;had sustained Floy in
the late interview with Mrs. Alden, and enabled her
to resign Espy with apparent indifference; but when
his mother had gone, leaving her alone, a sudden
sense of utter desolation came over the girl, and
hastening to her own room she locked her door, and
throwing herself on the bed, buried her face in its
pillows, while bitter, bursting sobs shook her whole
frame.</p>

<p>“Was ever sorrow like unto my sorrow?” was the
cry of the poor aching heart. “Have I not seen the
grave close over my more than parents, earthly
possessions swept away, and now resigned my love&mdash;all,
all that was left me!”</p>

<p>The storm of grief was violent but brief. She
seemed to hear again the prayer offered for her by
the aged saint standing at her side in that other
hour when heart and flesh were failing, and with
passionate earnestness went up the cry, “Lord, my
heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the Rock that is
higher than I!”</p>

<p>Ah, all was not lost! Himself He had left her
still, and with the thought she grew strong to do
and endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>She was endowed by nature with vigor of body and
mind, and much firmness and decision of character.
Her sobs were stilled, her tears ceased to
flow, while with determined resolve she forced her
thoughts to leave the past and busy themselves
with plans for the future.</p>

<p>A new hope, a new desire had been gradually
growing in her mind for the past few days. Her
mother&mdash;her own mother, who had so loved her in
her infancy&mdash;was there not a possibility that diligent,
persevering search might be rewarded by success
in finding her?</p>

<p>Perhaps she was still poor and ill&mdash;feeble in health&mdash;and
if so, oh, how gladly would her daughter toil
to supply her needs! how lavish filial love and tenderness
upon her&mdash;the poor weary one who had hungered
for them so long!</p>

<p>How she was to earn a support for herself alone
Floy did not know, but hope was strong within her
young breast, and she felt that with such an incentive
to exertion she could not fail.</p>

<p>“Yes, she does live, and I shall find her&mdash;my poor,
sorely-tried, precious mother!” she caught herself
saying half aloud.</p>

<p>There was a gentle rap on her door at that moment,
and a sweet-toned voice asked, “Shall I come
in, Miss Floy? If you would rather see me at
another time, dear, I’ll go away and come again.”</p>

<p>Floy sprang to the door and opened it, admitting
a little, plainly-dressed woman with a sweet face
framed in with silvery hair. A pair of mild blue
eyes looked pityingly into the tear-stained, sorrowful
face of the young mourner, and hastily depositing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
upon a chair a large package which she carried,
the little woman held out her arms.</p>

<p>Floy threw herself into them, hid her face on the
kindly bosom, and burst into a fit of passionate weeping.</p>

<p>Her friend soothed her with silent caresses till she
grew calmer, then spoke a few tender, sympathizing
words.</p>

<p>“You feel for me, dear Auntie Wells,” sobbed
Floy, “and yet you do not know nearly all that has
come upon me. I have one Friend who does; but
oh! our hearts crave human sympathy, and counsel
too, when we are young and inexperienced.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all, dear child, if you will; I have no
great store of worldly wisdom, only such as years
can give, but I have seen many more of them than
you, and my sympathy you shall certainly have.”</p>

<p>“I think you must have just the kind of wisdom
I want, because you have gone through just such
a lonely, struggling life as seems to be before me,”
Floy said, calming herself and wiping away her
tears.</p>

<p>“A lonely, struggling life for you, child!” Miss
Wells exclaimed in an incredulous tone as she passed
her hand caressingly over the pretty head resting on
her shoulder. “Struggling! with the fortune your
father has left you? lonely! with Espy still yours?
How can it be?”</p>

<p>“The fortune is not mine, and Espy!&mdash;I have&mdash;have
given him up!”</p>

<p>The first words were spoken low and hurriedly,
and the last came from the white lips in a sharp
cry of agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Utter astonishment dominated for the moment
every other feeling in Miss Wells’s breast; then infinite
pity and tenderness took its place, and gathering
the girl to her heart, she wept over her as her
own mother might, asking no questions, feeling no
curiosity, every other emotion lost in the boundless
compassion which would have done or suffered almost
everything to restore its object to happiness.</p>

<p>Hannah Wells, now far on the shady side of fifty,
a woman with a large, loving heart, had found few
upon whom to lavish the wealth of her affection,
and upon Floy she had poured it out without stint.</p>

<p>For many years she had maintained herself by
her needle, first as seamstress, then as dressmaker;
and employed by Mrs. Kemper in both capacities
ever since the coming of the latter to Cranley, had
often made her home in that house for weeks and
months together, always treated with the kindly
consideration accorded to a welcome guest or one of
the family; for, spite of her poverty, Miss Wells was
unmistakably a lady.</p>

<p>She was a woman, too, of excellent common-sense,
sterling integrity, and deep piety, evinced by a life of
blameless purity, a thoroughly consistent walk and
conversation.</p>

<p>She was now enjoying a moderate degree of prosperity,
having a little home of her own and something
laid by for a rainy day.</p>

<p>She kept a number of apprentices now, who usually
carried home the finished work, but loving Floy so
dearly, she had herself brought home the poor
child’s mourning.</p>

<p>The love and caresses of this old and tried friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
were as balm to the sorely-wounded heart. Floy
presently grew calmer, and poured out her whole
story, including her half-formed plans for the future,
seeking advice in regard to the latter.</p>

<p>Miss Wells entered into them with deep interest,
highly approving Floy’s course in regard to the
property, and of her resolve first to search for her
long-lost mother, then to seek employment by
which to earn a living for herself and for her mother
if found.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid to try it, dear,” Hannah said;
“try it with determination to let no difficulty conquer
you, yet trusting in the Lord, and you will succeed.
It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
confidence in man. Yes, dear, I’ve tried it, and proved
it in my own experience. Like you I was left an orphan
early in life, and without means. I had relations
who gave me a home, enough to eat, and decent
clothes, and didn’t seem to grudge it either; but I saw
that they had plenty of other uses for their money,
and I couldn’t bear to have them do without anything
in order to provide for me; so I resolved to strike out
bravely for myself, trusting only in the Lord, and
from that day to this He’s taken care of me: and its
so sweet, <em>so</em> sweet to take everything as a gift right
from His dear hand.”</p>

<p>As the dressmaker left, Espy came in and went
direct to the parlor, where Floy sat in an attitude of
deep dejection, her elbow on the arm of the sofa,
her cheek resting on her hand.</p>

<p>He sprang to her side, and, as she started and half
rose from her seat, caught both hands in his.</p>

<p>“Floy, Floy, what have they been doing? What
have they been saying to you? Never mind it,
darling, nothing shall ever come between us.”</p>

<p>The eyes that met his were full of anguish; the
lips moved, but no sound came from them.</p>

<p>He threw his arms about her as if to shield her
from harm. “Floy, dear, don’t mind it. I can’t
bear to see you look so. Isn’t my love enough to
make you happy? Ah, if you only knew <em>how</em> I love
you, dearest!”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;oh, Espy, I’ve given you up! I’ve no right
now to your love!”</p>

<p>“Given me up! Do you not love me, Floy?”
His voice grew hoarse with emotion.</p>

<p>“You are all I’ve left&mdash;all.”</p>

<p>He bent his ear to catch the low-breathed words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
His heart gave a joyous bound, and he drew her
closer to him; but she struggled to release herself.</p>

<p>“Espy, you are free. I have given you up.”</p>

<p>“I will not accept my freedom, nor give you
yours, my own little wife&mdash;I may call you that, because
we are pledged to each other, and it’s almost
the same: we belong to each other quite as much as
if we were already married.”</p>

<p>She shook her head with sad determination.
“Your father refuses his consent, and&mdash;I&mdash;I cannot
go into a family that is not willing to receive me.”</p>

<p>“My father had no right to withdraw the consent
already given!” he exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>“That was given to your union with the rich Miss
Kemper, not with a poor and nameless waif,” she
returned, with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>“Ah! but I pledged myself to neither the wealth
nor the name, but to the dear girl who has not
changed unless to grow dearer and lovelier still.”</p>

<p>“But I think children are bound to respect the
wishes, and certainly the commands, of their parents.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a child!” he cried, with a mixture of
anger and pride. “I shall be my own master in a
few months; then I shall not consider his consent
absolutely necessary, and in the mean time I shall
not break my engagement to you.”</p>

<p>“No, Espy, but I release you.”</p>

<p>“I will not be released!” he cried, with increasing
anger, “nor will I release you!”</p>

<p>“You will surely not be so ungenerous as to hold
me to it against my will?” she said coldly, averting
her face and moving farther from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden suspicion flashed upon him, a pang of
jealous rage stabbed him to the heart, and he grew
white and rigid.</p>

<p>“You love another; you have played me false, and
are glad of an excuse to get rid of me!” he said in
cutting tones.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but drew herself up proudly,
yet kept her face turned from him.</p>

<p>“Farewell, then, false girl; you are free!” he cried,
rushing madly from the room.</p>

<p>Floy looked after him, with a dreary smile more
pitiful than tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Espy, Espy! must we part like this?” she
sighed inwardly, putting her hand to her head.</p>

<p>“Miss Floy, are you sick? got a headache?”
queried Susan, coming in. “What can I do for ye?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you, Susan; I’ll be better soon.”</p>

<p>“Try a cup o’ tea; it’ll do ye good. I heard Mr.
Espy go ’way, and I thought I’d just come and tell
you that supper’s ready.”</p>

<p>Something in Susan’s tones jarred upon Floy’s
sensitive nerves, and, with a sort of dull comprehension
that the girl’s rising suspicions must be lulled
to rest, she rose, went to the table, and forced herself
to drink a cup of tea and swallow a few mouthfuls
of food.</p>

<p>The blow dealt her by Espy’s parting words began
to lose its stunning effects, and to be succeeded
by a feverish impulse to fly from him and from these
scenes of former happiness, of present sorrow and
loss. She left the table with the sudden resolve
that she would set out that very night on her intended
journey in search of her long-lost mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately Mr. Crosby, thinking of some new
question to ask, called at the door just as she was
passing through the hall on her way upstairs.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where to go, Miss Floy?”
he asked, when she had told him of her intention to
depart immediately.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I remember having heard
what route father and mother took in coming out
West, and she told me the name of the station where
they met my own mother and obtained possession of
me; I mean to go directly there and make inquiries.”</p>

<p>“You will find things greatly changed since
then,” he remarked, meditatively stroking his beard.
“Let me see: how many years?”</p>

<p>“Nearly sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! and these Western places grow so fast!
The lonely little station may have become a city, and
you are very young and&mdash;comely,” he added, with a
look of kindly concern. “My child, I hardly like
to see you start on this expedition alone, and yet I
have no authority to forbid it. Do you think you
can take care of yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I cannot,” she answered, low and
tremulously, “but the Father of the fatherless will
not leave me alone, and I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>A train going in the desired direction passed
through Cranley at midnight; it was the one Floy
must take. Mr. Crosby engaged to procure a
ticket for her, and to see her and her luggage safely
on board.</p>

<p>Also he advised her of the best mode of procedure
on arriving at Clearfield, exacting a promise
that she would write to him, giving an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the progress made, and seeking further counsel if
needed, while on his part he engaged to keep her
informed of his movements in regard to the settlement
of the estate.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, rising to go, “is there not
some lady friend whom I can call upon to come and
assist you in your packing or other necessary preparations
for this sudden flitting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you! Miss Wells! I know she
would come; and if you please, Mr. Crosby, will
you tell her it would be the very greatest comfort to
me?”</p>

<p>“I will, with pleasure, and I will be here in time
to take you to the train.”</p>

<span class="sub_head">“LOST! LOST! LOST!”</span></h2>

<p>Espy did not go home on leaving Floy; he was
in no mood for meeting his father, against whom
fierce anger was swelling in his breast. The lad’s ire
was not easily roused, but when once kindled it was
apt to blaze with fury until it had burnt itself out.</p>

<p>At this moment he felt like one whose hand was
against every man, and every man’s hand against
him; for had not Floy even, his own darling Floy,
cast him off and given her love to some one else?
Oh, the very thought was intolerable pain! he had
loved her so long and so dearly, and never better
than now; and yet he was angry with her, more
angry than words could express; angry with himself,
too, that he could not cast her out of his heart.</p>

<p>Full of these violent and contending emotions, he
hurried onward and still onward, heedless whither
his steps were tending, taking no note of time or
space or of the gathering darkness, till suddenly he
felt his strength failing, and in utter weariness cast
himself down on the grass by the roadside.</p>

<p>He glanced about him. Where was he? He could
not tell; but miles away from Cranley, for there were
no familiar landmarks.</p>

<p>“Lost!” he said aloud, with a bitter laugh, “actually
lost here in my own neighborhood; a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
joke truly. Well, I’ll find myself fast enough by
daylight. And what matter if I didn’t, now that
Floy has given me up?” And he dropped his head
into his hands with a groan.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching wheels aroused him.</p>

<p>“Why, hallo! can that be you, Alden?” cried a
familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Espy said, getting up and going to the
side of the gig. “How are you, Bob?”</p>

<p>The two had been schoolmates, and Robert Holt,
whose home was near at hand, soon persuaded Espy
to accompany him thither to spend the night.</p>

<p>Ill-used as Espy considered himself, and unhappy
as he certainly was, he found, when presently seated
before a well-spread board, in company with a lively
party of young people, that he was able to partake
of the tempting viands with a good deal of appetite.
Coffee, muffins, and fried chicken did much to
relieve his fatigue and raise his spirits, and the
evening passed quite agreeably, enlivened by conversation
and music.</p>

<p>It was late when at last the young people separated
for the night, Holt taking Espy with him to his
own room.</p>

<p>“Hark! there’s the twelve o’clock train; I’d no
idea it was so late,” said Holt as he closed the
door and set down the lamp.</p>

<p>Espy stepped hastily to the window, just in time to
see the train sweep by with its gleaming lights, the
outline of each car barely visible in the darkness.
Why did it make him think of Floy? He had no suspicion
that it was bearing her away from him; yet
so it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Thoughts of her in all her grief and desolation
disturbed his rest. He woke often, and when he
slept it was to dream of her in sore distress, and
turning her large, lustrous eyes upon him sadly, beseechingly,
and anon stretching out her arms as if
imploring him to come to her relief.</p>

<p>Morning found him full of remorse for the harsh
words he had spoken to her, and so eager to make
amends that he could not be persuaded to remain for
breakfast, but, leaving his adieus to the ladies with
Robert, set off for Cranley before the sun was up.</p>

<p>He reached the town in season for the early home
breakfast; but feeling that he could not wait another
moment to make his peace with Floy, turned in at
her gate first.</p>

<p>Glancing up at the house, it struck him as strange
that every door and blind was tightly closed.</p>

<p>He had never known Floy to lie so late when in
health, and a pang shot through his heart at the
thought that she must be ill.</p>

<p>He rang the bell gently, fearing to disturb her;
then, as no one came to answer it, a little louder.</p>

<p>Still no answer, not a sound within the dwelling;
he could hear his own heart beat as he stood waiting
and listening for coming footsteps that came not.</p>

<p>He grew frightened; he must gain admittance,
must learn what was wrong. Once more he seized
the bell-pull, jerked it violently several times, till
he could distinctly hear its clang reverberating
through the silent hall.</p>

<p>Still no response.</p>

<p>He hurried round to the side door, knocked loudly
there, then on to the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Still no sign of life.</p>

<p>He made a circuit of the house, glancing up and
down in careful scrutiny of each door and window,
till perfectly sure that every one was closely shut.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” he asked himself half
aloud, turning deathly pale and trembling like an
aspen leaf.</p>

<p>“Oh, Floy, Floy, I would give my right hand never
to have spoken those cruel words! inhuman wretch
that I was!”</p>

<p>Waiting a moment to recover himself, he then
hastened home. His father had eaten his breakfast
and gone to his office; his mother still lingered over
the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, Espy,” she said as he came in, “I’m glad to
see you. I’ve been keeping the coffee hot; beefsteak
too; and Rachel shall bake some fresh cakes.
Come and sit down. How dreadfully pale you look!
You’ve had too long a walk on an empty stomach.”</p>

<p>He seemed scarcely to hear her; but leaning his
back against the wall as if for support, “Mother,”
he said hoarsely, “what has become of her? Where
is she?”</p>

<p>“Who?” she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>He simply pointed through the window in the
direction of the next house.</p>

<p>She looked out. “Well, I declare! they’re not
up yet! I never knew them to lie abed till this hour
before.”</p>

<p>“They’re not there; nobody’s there unless&mdash;” he
gasped and shuddered, a new and terrible thought
striking him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unless what?”</p>

<p>“Burglars&mdash;murderers&mdash;such things have been;
we&mdash;we must break open the door or window&mdash;”</p>

<p>His mother’s face suddenly reflected the paleness
and agitation of his.</p>

<p>But Mr. Alden came hurrying in. “The house
next door is all shut up!” he exclaimed pantingly.
“Oh, Espy, so there you are! Come, come, don’t look
so terribly frightened! I met Crosby, and he tells
me Floy has left town&mdash;went off in the midnight
train, nobody knows where, after, like a fool, telling
him the whole story I so wanted her, for her own
good, to keep to herself. And he’s to have the settling
of everything; so there, we’re done with her!”</p>

<p>His son’s countenance had undergone several
changes while he was speaking&mdash;terror, despair, relief,
indignation, swept over it by turns.</p>

<p>“Done with her!” he repeated, drawing himself
up to his full height and gazing at his father with
flashing eyes; “done with her! No, sir, not <em>I</em>,
if I can ever find her again and persuade her to be
friends with me once more!”</p>

</div>

<p>Very lonely and desolate felt poor Floy as the
train sped onward, bearing her every moment farther
away from childhood’s home and friends out
into the wide, wide, unknown world.</p>

<p>What sad, unforeseen changes the past few days
had wrought in her young life! What a little while
since she had been moving thus swiftly toward her
home, instead of away from it, and under loving,
protecting care; whereas now she was utterly alone
so far as earthly companionship was concerned!</p>

<p>Alone and screened from human eyes behind the
closely-drawn curtains of her berth, she poured out
her tears and prayers to her one ever-living, ever-present
Friend.</p>

<p>“Do not fear, my poor dear child! do not fear to
trust Him!” Miss Wells had said in parting. “He
will help you and raise up friends for you wherever
you go.”</p>

<p>The words dwelt in the girl’s mind with soothing,
comforting power. She tried to cast her care on Him,
and presently her fears (for she could not forget the
dreadful accident of her last journey), her griefs, her
losses and perplexities, were forgotten in sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the next day that
she reached Clearfield, no longer a little country
station in the depths of a forest, but a flourishing
town numbering several thousands of inhabitants.</p>

<p>She had several times heard a description of the
place from both Mr. and Mrs. Kemper, but without
any allusion to the episode which had fixed it so
firmly in their memories. She glanced eagerly
about on stepping from the cars, but failed to recognize
a single feature of the scene. The shanty inn
had long since disappeared; the old dingy depot had
been replaced by a new and larger one, affording
much better accommodation to the travelling public;
and dwelling-houses, fields, and gardens now occupied
the space then covered by the wild growth of
the forest.</p>

<p>Floy had inquired of the last conductor on the
train the name of the best hotel in the town, and an
omnibus speedily carried her thither.</p>

<p>She asked for a room, and while waiting stepped
into the public parlor and, completely overcome
with fatigue, dropped into an easy chair, laid her
head back, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>A kind voice spoke close at her side, the speaker, a
motherly old lady glancing pityingly at the pale,
sad face and deep mourning dress.</p>

<p>“You are ill, my poor child, and seem to be quite
alone. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Floy opened her eyes languidly.</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you; I think I am not ill, only
very weary. They will show me to a room presently,
and then I can lie down and rest.”</p>

<p>“A cup of hot tea, Nelson,” said the old lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
turning to a servant who had just entered, “and
have a room&mdash;the one next to mine&mdash;made ready immediately
for this young lady.”</p>

<p>This old lady, as Floy soon learned, was the
mother of Mr. Bond, the proprietor of the hotel.
She proved a most kind and helpful friend to our
heroine, listening with great sympathy and interest
to the sad story which the young girl, won by her
motherly manner, presently told her without reserve,
except in the matter of the loss of the will and the
troubles growing out of it; then assisting her with
advice and needed co-operation in her self-appointed
task.</p>

<p>There were two weekly papers published in the
town. In the next issue of each of these an advertisement
was inserted, giving a brief statement of the
facts, with an offer of reward for any certain information
in regard to the missing woman or any of
those who had seen her and heard her story. At the
same time private inquiries were set on foot, and the
search prosecuted in every way with the utmost
activity and perseverance.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>For more than a month Floy tarried at Clearfield,
diligently pursuing her investigations, yet without
gaining the faintest clue to the fate of her whom she
so ardently desired to find.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the shanty inn had removed
farther west years ago, but to what particular point
none could tell; the two switchmen had gone into the
army early in the civil war and were probably
among the slain, and the telegraph operator, it was
conjectured, had met the same fate.</p>

<p>Floy of course knew nothing of the Heywoods;
but they too had left the vicinity so long ago that no
one who heard of her through the advertisements or
otherwise thought of connecting them with the object
of her search.</p>

<p>At length she was forced to give it up in despair.
She had spent a good deal in advertising, and her
means were nearly exhausted. The heirs, as Mr.
Crosby had duly informed her, had refused to allow
her any share in Mr. Kemper’s estate, and five hundred
dollars which he had deposited in a bank in her
name was all her inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>She must now do something for her own support.
Her education qualified her for teaching, but finding
no opening for that, while one presented itself for
the learning of dress-making, for which she possessed
both taste and talent, she decided to avail herself
of it.</p>

<p>Her plan was to go to Chicago and apprentice herself
to one of the most fashionable mantua-makers
there.</p>

<p>Miss Wells would have been rejoiced to take Floy
under her wing, but the girl felt an unconquerable
repugnance to beginning her new career in Cranley,
the scene of her former prosperity, and where she
could not hope to avoid occasionally meeting with
the Aldens.</p>

<p>In fact, her sensitive dread of such encounters led
to the resolve not to return thither at all, but to go
directly to the city and begin the new life at once,
such a place as she desired having been already secured
for her through some of her Clearfield friends.</p>

<p>She had formed a strong attachment for Mrs.
Bond, which was fully reciprocated. They could
not part without pain, yet cheered each other with
the hope of meeting again at no very distant day, as
Floy thought of returning to Clearfield to set up
business on her own account when once she should
be prepared for that.</p>

<p>“Don’t despair, dear child; brighter days will
come; something tells me you will find your mother
yet,” the old lady said in bidding her good-by.</p>

<p>As the train sped on its way through the busy
streets of the town, over the prairies dotted here and
there with neat farm-houses, and anon plunged into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
forests gay with the rich coloring of the Frost King’s
pencil, Floy set herself resolutely to put aside
thoughts of her losses, disappointments, anxieties,
and perplexities, and to fix them upon the blessings
that were still left her.</p>

<p>Gay and light-hearted she could not be, but hope
kindled anew within her as she thought on Mrs.
Bond’s last words. Ah, she would not despair! her
long-lost mother, and Espy too, would yet be restored.</p>

<p>His words had deeply wounded her, but surely the
love which had been given her from their very infancy
could not be so suddenly withdrawn.</p>

<p>“We are moving very slowly; something must be
wrong. Don’t you think so, miss?” queried a woman
in the next seat, turning suddenly around upon Floy.</p>

<p>The words startled our heroine from her reverie,
sending a sharp pang of grief and terror through her
heart as they vividly recalled the horrors of the accident
which had wrought her such woe. She had
been hardly conscious of the fact, but certainly the
train had gradually slackened speed for the last ten
minutes or more; and now it stood still.</p>

<p>“What is wrong? why do we stop here where there
is no station?” she asked of the conductor, who was
passing the car window.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” he said; “the boiler has
sprung a leak, and we’ll have to stand here a while
till they can get another engine sent down from
Clearfield.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” fretted a thoughtless girl, “we
shall be behind time all along the route now, miss
our connections, and have no end of trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>But Floy’s heart swelled with gratitude that things
were no worse.</p>

<p>They had two long hours of waiting ere the train
was again in motion, for the spot where it had halted
was several miles from the nearest town, to which
a messenger must be sent on foot to telegraph back
to Clearfield for another engine; and when at last
that arrived it had to propel the cars from behind,
and the progress made was much slower than by
the ordinary mode.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers ventured to relieve the
tedium of the detention by strolling about the prairie
in the near vicinity of their train, and for the greater
part of the time the car in which Floy sat was nearly
deserted.</p>

<p>Her attention was presently attracted by the fretting
of a little child.</p>

<p>“Mother, I’m hungry; gi’ me a cake.”</p>

<p>“Now do be quiet, Sammy; you know I hain’t
none for you,” returned the parent, “so what’s the
use o’ teasin’? I’d give it to you in a minute if I
had it.”</p>

<p>By Mrs. Bond’s thoughtful kindness Floy had
been supplied with a bountiful lunch. She was very
glad of that now, and opening her basket, she invited
mother and child to partake with her.</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss,” said the former, a decent-looking
countrywoman. “Sammy’ll be very glad of
a bit of bread if you’ve got it to spare. I’d have
brought a lunch along, but expected to be at my sister’s
afore this, and it didn’t seem worth while.”</p>

<p>“I have abundance for all three of us,” returned
Floy, with a winning smile, displaying her stores;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
“so do let me have the pleasure of sharing with
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come, mother,” said Sammy, tugging at her
skirts.</p>

<p>Thus urged, the woman accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>“Are you from Clearfield, miss?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have been there for the past month or more.
Is it there you live?”</p>

<p>“A little ways out o’ the town, on t’other side.
I’ve been in that neighborhood nigh on to fifteen
year now. Clearfield wasn’t much of a town when
father moved out there, but it’s growed powerful
fast these few years back.”</p>

<p>Floy’s heart gave a sudden bound, and she turned
an eager, questioning glance upon the speaker. “I
suppose you knew&mdash;everybody knew&mdash;every one
else in the place when it was so small?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, of course we did, an’ mother she kep’
a boardin’-house an’ boarded the railroad hands.
She was always for helping father along, and that’s
the way I do by my Sammy. He’s named for his pap,
you know,” nodding toward her boy and smiling
proudly on him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sirree! and I’m a-goin’ to be as big a man as
him some day!” cried the young hopeful, swallowing
down one mouthful with great gusto and hastily
cramming in another.</p>

<p>Floy pressed her hand to her side in the vain effort
to still the loud beating of her heart.</p>

<p>“Did&mdash;did you ever hear any of those men&mdash;speak
of a sort of shanty inn that stood not very far from the
old depot?”</p>

<p>“Oh my, yes! and I’ve see it many a time; ’twas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
there better’n a year, I should say, after we come to the
place. And I’ve heard Jack Strong (he was one o’ the
switchmen on the road, and boarded with us a long
spell after those folks pulled down their shanty and
moved off)&mdash;I’ve heard him tell a pitiful kind of a
story about a poor woman that come there one night
clear beat out travellin’ through the storm (for ’twas
an awful wild night, Jack said, so he did, a-rainin’
and hailin’, and the wind blowin’ so it blowed down
lots o’ big trees in the woods). Well, as I was a-sayin’,
the woman she’d been footing it all day, and
with a child in her arms too; and Jack he told how
some other folks that were there, a man and his wife,
coaxed her to give the little girl to them, tellin’
her she’d got to die directly, and she’d better provide
for it while she could; and how she give it to ’em
and then ran screamin’ after the cars, ‘My child,
my child! give me back my child!’ till she dropped
down like dead, and would have fell flat in the mud
and water in the middle of the road if Jack hadn’t
a-caught her in his arms.”</p>

<p>Floy’s hands were clasped in her lap, cold beads
of perspiration stood on her brow, her breath came
pantingly, and her dilated eyes were fixed on the
face of the narrator, who, however, was too busy
brushing the crumbs off Sammy’s Sunday jacket to
observe the look, but went on garrulously:</p>

<p>“Jack he carried her into the depot and laid her
down on the settee; and while they were tryin’ to
bring her to, an old gentleman (I disremember
his name now) come in his covered wagon fur
to git his son as was expected home from ’way off
somewheres, but wasn’t there (he didn’t come till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
next day, Jack said), and the old gentleman he took
the poor thing home with him.</p>

<p>“There, now, Sammy, hold still till I tie this hankercher
round your neck. Them clo’es won’t be fit
to be seen if you keep on droppin’ greasy crumbs
over ’em.”</p>

<p>Floy was making a desperate effort to be calm.</p>

<p>“Where did he take her?” she asked, half concealing
her agitated face behind the folds of her veil.</p>

<p>“Out to the old gentleman’s place; a splendid
place they said it was. I can’t say just how fur off
in the woods, where he’d cleared acres and acres of
land. Jack never see her after she was took out there,
but he said she didn’t die after all, but got married
to the young feller that I told you was comin’ home
on a visit to the old folks (I think they’d know’d
each other afore she was married the first time, and
kind a got separated somehow), and when she got
about again he took her back with him, and I guess
the old folks follered ’em after a bit.”</p>

<p>“Where, oh! where?” asked Floy imploringly.</p>

<p>The woman started and turned an earnest, inquiring
gaze upon her.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, but was they anything to you,
miss?”</p>

<p>“I was the baby! and I’m looking for my mother.
Oh, can you tell me where to find her?”</p>

<p>“That must a been a long while ago; you’re a
heap bigger’n me, and I ain’t no baby,” remarked
Sammy, disposing of the last mouthful of his lunch
and wiping his hands on his mother’s handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” ejaculated the latter in wide-eyed
astonishment. “And you was the baby! well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
now! Oh, do tell me! was those folks good to
you?”</p>

<p>“As kind, as tender and loving as my own
mother could possibly have been,” answered Floy,
with emotion. “But oh, tell me where I shall find
her!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I wish I knowed! but I never did know
whether ’twas to Californy or Oregon or some other
o’ them fur-off places that they went.”</p>

<p>“And the man who told you the story?”</p>

<p>“Jack Strong? he went off years and years ago.
They say he went to the war and got killed, and I
guess it’s true.”</p>

<p>The shrill whistle of a locomotive coming from the
direction of Clearfield sent the strolling passengers
hurrying back to the train. Pouring into the cars,
they settled themselves in their seats with relieved
faces and exchange of congratulations that this tedious
detention had at last come to an end.</p>

<p>Floy, who had borne it with resignation from the
first, was now more deeply thankful for it than words
can express. There came over her such a rush of
glad hopes and expectations as to leave no room at
the moment for the recollection that she had as yet
not the slightest clue to her mother’s whereabouts.
Even her sad bereavements and the cruel misunderstanding
with Espy were for a short space half forgotten
in the glad anticipation of again experiencing
the blessedness of the possession of a mother’s love.</p>

<p>She was leaning her head back against the side of
the car, her face concealed by her veil.</p>

<p>“Miss,” said Sammy’s mother, gently touching
her on the shoulder, “excuse me for waking you,
but we’re just ’most at my stoppin’-off place, and I
didn’t like to go without sayin’ good-by to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, that was right; I was not asleep,” said Floy,
putting aside her veil and offering her hand, tears
springing to her eyes, while a beautiful smile played
about her lips. “I can never thank you enough
for what you have told me to-day.”</p>

<p>“La sakes! ’tain’t nothin’ to thank me for,” returned
the kind-hearted creature, grasping the soft
little hand warmly in hers hardened by honest toil;
“you’re as welcome as can be, and Sammy and me’s a
thousand times obliged for the good dinner you give
us. Well, I hope you’ll find your mother, miss, and
when you do won’t you let me know? Just drop a
line to Mrs. Sam Dobbs, Clearfield, and I’ll be sure
to git it.”</p>

<p>“Wildbrier!” shouted the conductor at the door,
and Mrs. Dobbs hurried from the car.</p>

<p>The morning’s detention, causing more than one
failure in making connections, brought several vexatious
delays&mdash;long hours of tedious waiting in depots
in the loneliness of a crowd, and with few appliances
for comfort.</p>

<p>But Floy felt no temptation to fret or murmur;
all this was so infinitesimal a price to pay for what
she had gained.</p>

<p>When the train reached Chicago it was five o’clock
in the morning, and still dark.</p>

<p>No one to meet Floy, and she so utterly strange
to the city that she knew not which way to turn to
find the street and number given her as the address
of Mrs. Sharp, whose apprentice she was to be.</p>

<p>No express agent had come on the train to attend
to the delivery of baggage; not a hack nor an omnibus
was in waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>She was looking this way and that in search of
one, when a young man of rough exterior but
kindly, honest face, as she could see by the light of
a lamp near by, stepped up with the question:</p>

<p>“Any baggage, miss?”</p>

<p>“Yes; can you tell me where to find an omnibus
or hack?”</p>

<p>“No, miss, there’s none here; they come to
meet the regular trains, but this un’s out o’ time&mdash;about
three hours behind.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I to do?” she asked in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Well, miss, I’ll take your trunk wherever it’s to
go, and if you like you can just go along in the express
wagon. ’Tain’t as suitable for you as a nice
carriage, to be sure, but it’ll carry you safe and comfortable.
Where’s the place?”</p>

<p>Floy gave him the number and street, and, accepting
his offer with thanks as the best she could do
under the circumstances, mounted to her elevated
perch on the front seat, the young man giving her
the assistance of his hand.</p>

<p>She saw her trunk placed behind her in the wagon,
and presently found herself being driven rapidly
through the almost deserted streets, for the city was
but just beginning to rouse from its slumbers.</p>

<p>The morning air was chilly, blowing fresh and
keen from the lake; the girl’s mood silent and sad,
for, alas! no glad welcome, no loving caress, nor even
a familiar face would greet her in the new abode (she
could not call it home) to which she was hastening.</p>

<p>But her gallant charioteer, who had, perchance,
never before had so sweet a face by his side, did his
best to entertain and amuse her, pointing out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
district swept by the great fire, relating incidents
connected with it, and calling her attention to the
fine buildings which had already sprung up in the
places of those destroyed.</p>

<p>Arrived at her destination, he leaped nimbly from
his perch, gave the door-bell a vigorous pull, and assisted
her to alight.</p>

<p>There was a sound of quick pattering steps, the
forcing back of a bolt, the turning of a key; the door
was hastily jerked open, and Floy just caught a
glimpse of a narrow hall with its oil-cloth-covered
floor, an unkempt head and dirty face in the foreground,
and all was darkness.</p>

<p>“There, the wind’s blowed the candle out! Miss
Hetty, Miss Hetty, come right here! quick!”
screamed the owner of the head. Then to Floy,
“Who are you? and what d’ye want so awful
early? We don’t never ’spect no customers this time
in the morning.”</p>

<p>But before Floy could speak another person appeared
upon the scene&mdash;a girl not many years older
than herself, neat and trim in dress, and with a
bright, intelligent, cheery, though homely face.</p>

<p>She came from the farther end of the hall, carrying
a lighted lamp, and, holding it high over her head,
peered into the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>“What <em>are</em> you making such a racket about,
Patsy Devine? You’ll wake everybody in the
house and our Sharp Thorne will give you a prick.”
Then catching sight of Floy just stepping aside
out of the way of the expressman, who was bringing
in the trunk, “Oh! how d’ye do?” she said. “I
suppose its&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Kemper&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, the young lady Aunt Prue&mdash;Mrs. Sharp&mdash;was
expecting. It’s all right.”</p>

<p>The expressman set down the trunk, received his
pay, and departed.</p>

<p>Miss Hetty secured the door after him, and turning
to Floy, said:</p>

<p>“Breakfast’s about ready to set on the table, so
it won’t be worth while for you to climb the stairs
till afterwards.”</p>

<p>“I am hardly fit to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll provide you with means for removing
the coal-dust from face and hands,” interrupted
Hetty briskly, leading the way into the dining-room
and across it to a closet, where she turned the water
into a stationary washstand, and taking a clean
towel and piece of soap from a drawer, laid them
down beside it.</p>

<p>“There, just take off your things and give them
to me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but&mdash;my hair?” said Floy, “I never
sat down to breakfast in my life without first using
a comb and brush.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just smooth it a little on top, and it’ll do
well enough for this once; we’re all women and
girls together; not a man in the house except Mr.
Sharp, and he never comes to our early breakfast.”</p>

<p>The shadow of a smile flitted over the face of the
new-comer.</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Hetty, divining her thought, “I
would not be a slattern if all the men were at the
bottom of the sea. Don’t judge of me by Patsy, I
beg of you,” she added, with an odd grimace; “dirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and she have so strong an affinity for each other that
there’s no keeping them apart.” And taking Floy’s
hat and shawl, she hurried away. She was back
again by the time our heroine had finished her hasty
toilet.</p>

<p>Floy’s story had not preceded her. She had not
felt willing that it should, and even Mrs. Sharp
knew little more than that she was a young girl of
good family who wished to learn dress-making and
millinery.</p>

<p>But the deep mourning told of recent bereavement,
and something in the patient sadness of the
face went to Hetty’s warm heart. With a sudden
impulse she threw her arms about Floy and kissed
her.</p>

<p>“You poor thing, so far away from home and all
you love!” she said, “it must seem terribly hard.”</p>

<p>Floy’s lip trembled and her eyes filled. She could
only return the embrace in silence; her heart was
too full for speech.</p>

<p>“Hetty!” said a voice from the dining-room,
“Hetty, isn’t it time to ring the bell?”</p>

<p>“In a minute, mother, as soon as I can dish up
the meat and potatoes,” answered the girl, stepping
out and drawing Floy with her. “Mother, this is
Miss Kemper, the young lady that was expected to
come from the West, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodenough, as Floy afterward learned to
call her, was a heavy-featured, gray-haired, sallow
woman, as dull, absent-minded, and slow as Hetty
was bright and quick.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; how d’ye do? But I didn’t know there
was a train came in so early,” she said, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
hands with Floy. “Ring that bell quick, Patsy!”
as a step was heard in the hall, slipshod but hasty
and impatient.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodenough waddled into the kitchen (she
was stout in figure and clumsy in gait). Patsy seized
the bell, and Hetty came hurrying in with a dish of
baked potatoes just as the door opened and another
woman, alert in movement and sharp of feature,
with a keen black eye, hair in crimping-pins, and a
tall, wiry figure arrayed in a calico wrapper, clean
and fresh but evidently thrown on in haste, came
bustling in.</p>

<p>“Sarah, it’s getting late, and you know how the
work’s hurrying us&mdash;six or eight dresses to be made
this week, and&mdash;ah?” in a tone of inquiry as her eye
fell upon Floy standing silently there.</p>

<p>Patsy’s bell was clanging in the hall.</p>

<p>“Miss Kemper, Aunt Prue!” shouted Hetty.
“Breakfast’s ready now, and it isn’t quite six yet.”</p>

<p>Floy received a hasty nod, the black eyes scanning
her from head to foot; then dashing into the hall,
Mrs. Sharp seized Patsy with one hand, the bell with
the other.</p>

<p>“That’s enough! will you never learn when to
stop? How do you suppose Mr. Sharp can sleep
through all this din? Come, girls, make haste!”
and she turned into the dining-room again, followed
by four apprentices, to whom the last words
were addressed as they came flying down the stairs.</p>

<p>In a trice all had gathered about the table, Mrs.
Goodenough pouring out the coffee, Mrs. Sharp
helping to the meat, and the others passing the
bread, butter, and potatoes; then all fell to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
as if their lives depended upon finishing the meal
in the shortest possible space of time&mdash;all but the
new-comer, who bent reverently over her plate for a
moment ere she took up her knife and fork.</p>

<p>She had been assigned a place at Mrs. Goodenough’s
right hand. Hetty, who sat opposite,
looked approval, but Mrs. Sharp’s comment was an
impatient gesture, which, however, Floy did not
see.</p>

<p>“We expected you last night,” Mrs. Sharp said
presently.</p>

<p>Floy explained about the detention.</p>

<p>“Ah! and you’re tired out most likely? won’t be
fit to work to-day, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to try,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“She ought to have a nap first,” said Hetty impulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes, she looks tired,” remarked Mrs. Goodenough
slowly; “and what is it Shakespeare says?”</p>

<p>She dropped knife and fork, and with eyes fixed
upon vacancy seemed to be vainly striving to recall
some apt quotation which had half suggested itself,
then slipped away before she could quite secure it.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Sarah!” exclaimed her sister impatiently,
pushing back plate and chair and jumping
up in haste, “I’m the first done, as usual. Girls,
don’t be all day over your breakfast. Wash your
hands and come right into the work-room as soon as
you’re done; there’s no time to waste. Miss Kemper,
take a nap if you need it. I’m not hard on my
employees, even though my customers do drive me
almost to distraction.”</p>

<p>She left the room without waiting for a reply, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the four apprentices followed almost immediately
in a body, Floy rose too.</p>

<p>“Patsy and I will take your trunk up, Miss Kemper,”
said Hetty. “It’s small, and we can easily
carry it.”</p>

<p>“But is there not some man I could hire?”</p>

<p>“No, none near that I know of. Just let me have
my own way. I’m used to it, ain’t I, mother?”
laughed Hetty.</p>

<p>“Of course you are, Hetty,” returned Mrs. Goodenough
absently, sipping her tea. “What is it
Shakespeare says?”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Up three flights of stairs the trunk was carried,
Floy following close behind, laden with satchel, hat,
and shawl.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Hetty pantingly, setting it down
in the corner and straightening herself with her
hands upon her hips, “I feel relieved; I’ve had
my own way, and that’s something I always enjoy,”
and she wound up with a cheery little laugh.</p>

<p>All Floy’s protestations had been good-naturedly
overruled, Hetty declaring herself a sort of female
Samson, and the trunk very small and light.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Floy, “but you should
have let me hire some one.”</p>

<p>“No, no! no telling how long we’d have been
kept waiting, or how many customers would have
stumbled over or against it, or caught their dresses
on it in the mean time. Whew! how close this room
is! The girls rush down without waiting to open a
window,” hastily throwing up one as she spoke.
“I’m sorry I’ve no better or lower accommodations
to offer you, Miss Kemper,” she went on laughingly.
“It’s a shame to make you climb so many stairs, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
one of the things that can’t be helped. That’s your
bed in the corner there,” pointing to a single bed
which seemed not to have been occupied. “Do lie
down and rest a little; sleep if you can. I must run
right away,” and she flew downstairs.</p>

<p>Floy glanced about her. A great bare attic room,
an old carpet, faded and worn, covering the middle
of the floor; furniture scanty&mdash;just an old bureau,
three chairs, all much hacked and scratched with
long, hard usage; several unmade beds, each of which
had evidently been occupied by two persons through
the past night; and her own little one, which looked
neat and inviting with its coarse but clean sheets
and cheap white counterpane.</p>

<p>Everything indeed was clean, yet the room was
disorderly and without a suggestion of comfort or
prettiness in its appointments.</p>

<p>What a contrast to her own cosey, tasteful room in
the old home!</p>

<p>She walked to the window and looked out. Day
had fully dawned, and the busy hum of the awakening
city came to her ear with no unpleasing sound.
No velvety lawn, no garden gay with flowers, no
nodding trees or softly wooded hills met her view;
instead, bare roofs and domes and spires; but beyond
these lay the great lake, its waters rippling in
the morning breeze. And even as she gazed, far
away to the east where sea and sky seemed to meet,
a long line of rose color showed itself, deepened
rapidly to crimson, brightened into gold; rays of
light shot upward, quickly followed by the sun,
“rejoicing as a strong man to run a race,” and
sending his bright beams over the wide expanse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
waters till each wavelet’s edge was tipped with burnished
gold.</p>

<p>Floy leaned against the window-frame, hands
clasped and eyes drinking in eagerly all the glory
and beauty of the scene, loneliness, bereavement,
all earthly ills forgotten for the moment.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she sighed half aloud, “if Espy were here!
if he could but transfer this to canvas!”</p>

<p>Then all the grief and anguish of their estrangement,
all the sorrow and loss that preceded and
mingled with it, came rushing back upon her with
well-nigh overwhelming force, and her slight, willowy
form bent like a reed before the blast.</p>

<p>She sank upon her knees, her head resting upon
the window-seat, her hands tightly clasped above an
almost breaking heart.</p>

<p>A burst of wild weeping, tears falling like rain,
bitter choking sobs following thick and fast upon
each other, then a great calm; an effort at first feeble,
but growing stronger by degrees, to roll the burden
too heavy for her upon One able and willing to
bear it, a soothing, comforting remembrance of His
promise never to leave nor forsake, and anon the
glad thought that she whose love was only second
to His might yet be found.</p>

<p>“She may be near, very near me even now,”
whispered the girl to herself, “in this city, this
street, but a few doors away; it may be for that I
have been sent here. Oh, what a thought! what joy
if we should meet! But would we recognize each
other? Mother, oh, mother! should I know your
face if I saw it?”</p>

<p>She rose, tottered to the glass over the bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>,
and earnestly scanned her own features. With a
half-smile she noted their worn and haggard look.
Grief, care, and fatigue seemed to have done the
work of years.</p>

<p>“It is well,” she said. “I think I know now
how she looks&mdash;my own poor, weary, heart-broken
mother!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kemper had told Floy that, allowing for
difference in age, health, and circumstances, she was
in face and form almost the exact counterpart of her
own mother, and this was not the first time that the
girl had earnestly studied her own face, trying to
anticipate the changes to be wrought in it by the
wear and tear of the next eighteen or twenty years,
that thus she might be ready to know at a glance
that other one she so longed to look upon.</p>

<p>She turned from the glass with a long, weary sigh,
took off her dusty dress, shook out her abundant
tresses, donned a wrapper, crept into the bed that
had been pointed out as hers, and when Patsy came
up an hour later to tidy the room, was sunk in a
slumber so profound that she knew of neither the
coming nor going of the child.</p>

<p>She was roused at last by a slight shake and the
voice of the little maid.</p>

<p>“Miss, miss, they’re a-settin’ down to the table;
don’t ye want some dinner? Miss Hetty she told me
to ax ye.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” cried Floy, starting up. “Yes,
I’ll be down in a moment; I’d no thought of sleeping
so long!”</p>

<p>It was the work of a very few minutes to gather
up her hair into a massive coil at the back of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
head and put on one of her simply-made but becoming
mourning dresses.</p>

<p>She entered the dining-room with a quaking
heart, not knowing what severe looks or reproaches
might be meted out to her unpunctuality.</p>

<p>Patsy’s report had been, however, not quite correct,
and she was but a moment behind the others.</p>

<p>They were the same party she had met at breakfast,
with the addition of a middle-aged, cadaverous-visaged
man with a perpetual frown on his brow
and a fretful expression about the mouth, who, as she
entered, was in the act of carving a leg of mutton.
He honored our heroine with a stare which she felt
like resenting.</p>

<p>“Miss Kemper, Uncle Thorne,” said Hetty.</p>

<p>“Ah, how d’ye do, miss? Will you be helped to
a bit of a poor man?”</p>

<p>“Sir?” she said with a bewildered look.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! don’t you know that’s what the
Scotch call a leg of mutton? I’m sure you’ll find it
relishing. Just send me your plate by the fair hands
of our young Devine. I fear her divinity lies altogether
in name, for certainly she’s neither heavenly
nor spiritual, supernatural nor superhuman in appearance.”</p>

<p>“No,” remarked Mrs. Goodenough in her slow,
absent way as Patsy took the plate, “she’s not
equivalent to that. What is it Shakespeare says?”</p>

<p>“My classical sister&mdash;” began Mr. Sharp, in mock
admiration.</p>

<p>“Aunt Prue,” asked Hetty hastily, “did Mrs.
Cox decide whether she would have real lace on her
bonnet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and on the dress too. She’s running up a
large bill, but she is able to pay it.”</p>

<p>“She or her husband?” asked Mr. Sharp with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“She has none.”</p>

<p>“Fortunate creature!” exclaimed Hetty in an
aside.</p>

<p>“She’s a rich widow,” continued Mrs. Sharp; and
from that the talk went on, running altogether upon
flowers, laces, and ribbons, hats, bonnets, and dresses,
and the latest styles for each.</p>

<p>“What puerilities!” remarked Mr. Sharp at
length; “but the average female mind seems capable
of dwelling upon nothing but trifles.”</p>

<p>“And some male bodies&mdash;not a few either&mdash;appear
to be quite willing to live upon&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hetty, Hetty,” interrupted her mother, “don’t
be personal.”</p>

<p>“Humph! let her talk!” he said with sarcasm;
“it amuses her and harms no one. It’s no fault of
hers that she wasn’t given an intellect capable of appreciating
literary labor.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” remarked his wife. “How does the
work progress, Thorne? I hope this has been a good
day for you.”</p>

<p>“A woman of sense, knowing how my morning
nap was broken in upon by unnecessary noises, and
how very unsuitable was the breakfast served up to
me afterward, would not ask such a question,” he
answered loftily.</p>

<p>“Come, girls,” said his wife, rising hastily, “I
think we are all done, and there’s not a minute to be
lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Floy rose with the others and accompanied them to
the work-room.</p>

<p>“What can you do, Miss Kemper?” asked Mrs.
Sharp.</p>

<p>“I think I may say I have been thoroughly drilled
in plain sewing both by hand and with the machine,”
Floy answered modestly; “and for the last
year I have fitted and made my common dresses, and
generally assisted with the better ones.”</p>

<p>“You may begin with this,” said Mrs. Sharp,
handing her a dress-skirt of cheap material.</p>

<p>“That sounds very well, but we shall see what
we shall see,” was what Floy read in her countenance.
“And she shall see,” was the girl’s mental
resolve.</p>

<p>“She’s a treasure&mdash;this new arrival&mdash;if she only
keeps on as she’s begun,” Mrs. Sharp said, with a
triumphant smile, talking to Hetty that night after
the apprentices and journey-women had retired; “as
handy and neat a sewer as ever you saw, both by hand
and on the machine, and turns off nearly twice as
much work as any one of the others.”</p>

<p>“That’s splendid, Aunt Prue,” returned Hetty,
“but we must be careful not to work a willing
horse to death.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Hetty; did I ever do that?”</p>

<p>An odd little smile played about the girl’s lips,
but she only said:</p>

<p>“We’ve taken in a good many orders to-day; sold
off most of our stock of ready-made hats too, and&mdash;there!
it’s striking eleven, and I have two hats to
trim before I go to bed.”</p>

<p>“You’re worth your weight in gold, Hetty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
it’s a fine thing you need so little sleep,” remarked
her aunt. “But I think Sarah should relieve you
of the oversight of Patsy and the meals more than
she does.”</p>

<p>“Mother’s not well,” said Hetty shortly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s hipped; it’s more that than anything
else,” laughed Mrs. Sharp. “Good-night,” and she
left the room.</p>

<p>“Hipped! of course she is! Everybody is that
complains of anything, except that Sharp Thorne
of hers,” muttered Hetty, adjusting flowers, feathers,
and loops of ribbon with deft and rapid fingers.
“And of course I wouldn’t enjoy being in bed now,
or lying an hour later in the morning! Well, thank
Heaven, I haven’t a man to support, and don’t need
one to support me,” she added cheerily.</p>

<p>“Hetty Goodenough, you’ll have to interfere,
and set your foot down firmly too, or the child’s
health will be ruined for life,” remarked that young
lady to herself, stealing another and another furtive
glance at the wan, thin cheeks of Floy Kemper.
“Why, she’s but the ghost of the pretty girl the expressman
brought here two months ago.”</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays were near at hand, and
for weeks past orders for party-dresses, head-dresses,
opera cloaks, etc., had poured in upon the establishment
till, as Mrs. Sharp said, they were driven almost
to distraction.</p>

<p>It was now near midnight following one of the
hardest days of the season, and all the weary toilers
save these two had left the work-room to seek the
rest so sorely needed.</p>

<p>“Floy,” said Hetty aloud.</p>

<p>They had long since taken up the habit of calling
each other by these familiar names.</p>

<p>“Well, Hetty?” and the girl, who was busily engaged
in looping up the folds of rich silk and lace on
an over-skirt, with delicate blossoms wonderfully
real in their loveliness, looked up from her work
with a faint smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do give that up for to-night; you’ve done too
much to-day by a great deal.”</p>

<p>“But it can’t be helped while so many are hurrying
us so for their dresses, and this will be done now
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“The heartless creatures!” ejaculated Hetty.
“There’s nothing hardens the heart like love of
dress, Floy; I’d rather be&mdash;what I am&mdash;worked half
to death&mdash;than a butterfly of fashion. Well, if you’re
determined to finish that, I must come and help
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Floy. “What makes you so
good to me, Hetty?”</p>

<p>“It’s odd, isn’t it? but somehow I took a fancy to
you the first minute I set eyes on you.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve been the one bright spot in my life
here ever since.”</p>

<p>Hetty looked both touched and gratified.</p>

<p>“There, it’s done at last!” she said presently,
holding up their finished work, gazing at it admiringly
for an instant as she shook out the rich folds;
then carrying it to a closet, she hung it up carefully,
shut and locked the door, putting the key in her
pocket, and came back to Floy.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked almost tenderly, for Floy
sat in a despondent attitude, her elbow on the table,
her cheek on her hand, while her eyes, gazing into
vacancy, had a deeply sad, far-away look.</p>

<p>“I was only thinking,” she answered with an
effort to speak cheerfully; but her voice broke, and
a sudden gush of tears followed the words.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me! I&mdash;I didn’t mean to!” she faltered,
dashing away the bright drops and vainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
struggling to recover her composure, as Hetty
dropped on one knee at her side and put her arms
affectionately about her.</p>

<p>“You’re just worn out; that’s one trouble, but I’m
afraid not the only one. I’m not curious, and don’t
want to obtrude myself into your confidence, but if
you want sympathy&mdash;I’d be ever so glad to give it.
I&mdash;I’ve thought sometimes ’twould do you good to
unburden your heart to some one. You’re homesick,
I’m sure of that, for I know the symptoms.
The home folks ought to write to you oftener than
they do. I’ve noticed the postman has brought you
only two or three letters since you came, and one of
those was from an attorney at law.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the others were from one who is a
dear, kind friend, but has no drop of my blood in
her veins. Hetty, I never had a sister or brother.
Last year&mdash;oh! only four short months ago&mdash;I was a
petted only child, the darling of the best, kindest,
dearest of parents; now&mdash;I am alone&mdash;all alone! The
grave closed over them both in one day.”</p>

<p>The last words were scarcely audible, but Hetty’s
quick ear caught them, and her warm heart bled for
the bereaved one. She clasped her more closely in
her arms and wept with her.</p>

<p>“Poor dear, poor dear!” she said, “what a
pleasant home you must have had with them!
Wouldn’t it do you good to talk of it to me?”</p>

<p>Floy felt that it would, and in trembling, tearful
tones drew a bright picture of the happy home of
her childhood, the tender parental love and care that
had made it such in no ordinary degree.</p>

<p>Hetty was just the deeply-interested, sympathizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
listener the poor heart craved, and the outpouring
relieved it of half its load.</p>

<p>“What a change for you&mdash;coming here!” was Hetty’s
comment; “and how well you have borne it!
so patient, so uncomplaining, so diligent, and faithful!
I hardly know how you can have sufficient
energy and ambition.”</p>

<p>“A strange remark coming from you,” returned
Floy, smiling faintly as she wiped away the tears she
had been shedding to the memory of the dear ones
gone, “you who seem to me to be the very embodiment
of energy and ambition.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m used to the life, and I have an object;
poor mother has only me to relieve her of her heavy
burdens; love of her lightens toil wonderfully!”</p>

<p>“Love of Another too, Hetty; isn’t it so? And I
too can rejoice in the hope that He is pleased when I
strive to do my work faithfully, because it is of His
appointment, and be patient under trial, because He
sends it.”</p>

<p>Hetty silently pressed the hand she held, a tender
moisture gathering in her eyes.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;yes, I will tell you, for I am sure you are
a true friend, one worthy of my confidence. I
have another object in life besides the necessity of
earning my own support.”</p>

<p>And in a few brief, eager sentences, alight shining
in her eyes, a tender smile hovering around her full,
red lips, Floy told of her hope that she had still a
mother living, and should some day be able to search
her out.</p>

<p>Hetty listened to the tale in almost breathless surprise
and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll find her!” she cried, “you’ll find each
other&mdash;I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“And so am I at times, but I seem to make no
progress of late. I so seldom get out even into the
street, or go anywhere that I am likely to meet strangers.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be in the store,” said Hetty musingly;
“perhaps that can be managed by and by,
and in the meanwhile I’ll be on the lookout for you.
You resemble her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, allowing for the difference in age. Oh, it
seems to me I should know the face if I saw it!”</p>

<p>It was past midnight now, and as the girls must be
up by five o’clock in the morning, it behooved them
to retire at once.</p>

<p>They bade each other good-night and stole softly
upstairs, Hetty stopping on the third floor while
Floy went on up to the attic.</p>

<p>It was indeed a change from her old home in Cranley
to this that hardly deserved the name, and not
more the change in the accommodations and surroundings
than in the life she led&mdash;leisure, petting
indulgence, tender, watchful care in the one; in the
other incessant toil, seldom rewarded by so much as
a word or smile of approval, very plain fare, her happiness
evidently a matter of indifference to all about
her except warm-hearted, sympathizing Hetty.</p>

<p>But Floy had borne it well; silent and abstracted
she often was, scarce hearing the idle chatter of the
others, but always diligent and faithful in the performance
of the tasks assigned her; no eye-service
was hers, and though often very weary and
heart-sick, no complaint passed her lips or could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
read in her countenance; what her hand found to
do she did with her might, and having, as Mrs.
Sharp discovered ere she had been in the house a
week, a decided genius for cutting, fitting, and trimming,
she had been worked very hard, and was already
secretly esteemed an invaluable acquisition to
the establishment.</p>

<p>She was breaking down under the unaccustomed
strain; she needed the generous, varied, and nutritious
diet, the abundance of fresh air and exercise,
and somewhat of the rest and freedom from care of
the olden time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp was slow to perceive this, but Hetty
had suspected it for days past, and to-night had
become fully convinced.</p>

<p>She did not lie awake thinking of it, for, like Floy,
she was weary enough to fall asleep the moment her
head touched the pillow, but it was her last thought
on lying down, her first on awaking, and she sprang
up, saying half aloud:</p>

<p>“It shall be attended to, and this very day, sure
as you’re born, Hetty Goodenough!”</p>

<p>“What, Hetty?” asked her mother drowsily.</p>

<p>“Can’t wait to explain now, mothery; the clock’s
striking five; will another time. Just turn over and
take another nap while Patsy and I get breakfast.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame! I ought to get up and let you nap
it a little longer. What is it Shakespeare says?”
muttered Mrs. Goodenough sleepily, turning over as
she was bidden to do.</p>

<p>Hetty laughed low and musically as she threw on
a wrapper, caught up a shawl, and hurried from the
room. She was a power in that house, and knew it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
too. Mr. Sharp was a penniless dependent upon his
wife, who, starting in business with a very small capital,
had managed by dint of great exertions to add
something to it, and at the same time to support the
family and educate their children.</p>

<p>No easy life was hers, as Hetty said; she had
shown herself neither prudent nor sharp when she
consented to take such a Thorne to her bosom as the
lazy, supercilious, self-indulgent husband who, while
looking down with contempt upon her from the lofty
heights of his intellectual superiority, whether real
or fancied, was yet none too proud to live upon her
hard earnings; and instead of showing any gratitude
for the favors heaped upon him, was perpetually
grumbling and finding fault.</p>

<p>His wife bore with and excused him on the plea of
ill-health; but Hetty’s opinion, not always kept entirely
private, was that he was quite as capable of
exertion as the rest of them if he would only think so,
and that if by any possibility he could be forced to
leave his bed at the early hour set for the rest of the
family, and then to go to work with a will at something
useful and remunerative, it would have an excellent
effect upon him both mentally and physically.</p>

<p>But alas! she had not the power to enforce her
cure, and he went on from day to day dozing away
the precious morning hours, often the afternoon
also, then sitting up far into the night at some literary
work that never paid. Sometimes it was an
English grammar that was never finished, at others
an essay on some subject in which the public could
not be brought to take an interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>He was soured by disappointment, considering
himself a very ill-used man, and could not be made
to see that the trouble lay in his selfish determination
to do only what he liked, whether it would or would
not pay and enable him to support himself and family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodenough, nominally at the head of the
housekeeping department, lacked her sister’s native
energy, and was really out of health, and the greater
part of that burden was assumed by Hetty, who was
a perfect embodiment of vigor and efficiency.</p>

<p>Hetty had charge of the millinery part of the concern
also, including a store in which she had invested
a few hundreds inherited from her father, bringing
to the business also a thorough knowledge of the
trade.</p>

<p>She kept the accounts too, and was in fact quite
as much the mainspring of the whole establishment
as Mrs. Sharp herself, if not more so.</p>

<p>And this was well for the employees, since it was
by Hetty’s oversight of marketing and cooking that
the table was supplied with a sufficiency of wholesome,
well-prepared food, and meals were served
with the regularity so necessary to health.</p>

<p>She could not wholly save them from being overworked,
or indeed herself either, but the hours of
labor were sometimes abridged by her thoughtful
kindness in exerting her influence to that end.</p>

<p>Floy came down to breakfast with a violent headache.
She said nothing about it, but her look of
suffering and want of appetite did not escape Hetty’s
watchful eye, and made her more determined than
ever to come speedily to the rescue.</p>

<p>The opportunity offered shortly after the conclusion
of the meal. Leaving her mother and Patsy to
clear it away, Hetty hurried into the store. It was
still too early to open, but there were accounts to be
looked over and things to be set right before she
would be ready for customers.</p>

<p>She had not been there long when Mrs. Sharp
came in with the over-skirt she had helped Floy to
finish the night before.</p>

<p>“See, Hetty, what do you think of this?” she
asked, with a pleased look. “Some of Miss Kemper’s
work. She really has a wonderful amount of
taste.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so; it’s perfectly lovely, Aunt Prue;
you never had an apprentice before, or a journey-woman
either, for that matter, who could trim half
so prettily or had so many original ideas about it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp assented, shaking out the dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
gazing admiringly upon it as she turned it this way
and that to note the effect.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said complacently, “we’ve secured a
real treasure in her, and I never shall regret having
consented to take her.”</p>

<p>“She’s worth taking care of.”</p>

<p>“Of course she is, Hetty; but what do you mean
by that?” asked the aunt sharply.</p>

<p>“That she isn’t getting sleep enough, or fresh air
or exercise enough; that this work, work, work, from
early morning until late at night, is breaking down
her health, and we’ll have to manage differently as
far as she’s concerned, or we’ll have her dying on
our hands.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Het,” in a vexed tone, “you have a
way of putting things so strongly, and in such a
sudden fashion too, that I declare it nearly knocks
one down! She’s no more overworked than you
or I.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but we’re used to it, and naturally
stronger, I think. Besides, we don’t sit so
steadily, but are here and there, all over the house,
and in and out too, shopping or marketing.”</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be helped while we’re so driven
with work.”</p>

<p>“Better spare her for an hour or two every day
now than lose her services for weeks or maybe altogether.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp tossed the dress on to the counter and
sat down with her hands folded in her lap. For a
moment she seemed lost in thought, her countenance
expressing a good deal of annoyance.</p>

<p>“I generally send Annie Jones home with finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
work,” she said presently, “because she’s not good
for much else; but if Miss Kemper is really in such
pressing need of air and exercise, she may take that
duty sometimes. I don’t believe, though, that she’ll
be willing; she is too high in her notions.”</p>

<p>“She is a lady, and would of course feel it somewhat
of a trial to her pride,” said Hetty, “but I believe
she is too sensible and right-minded to refuse,
when it’s so necessary for her health.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Floy was called and the question laid before her.</p>

<p>The result was as Hetty had predicted&mdash;an evident
struggle with pride, then a thankful acceptance
of the offer. Health was far too valuable to be
lightly thrown away, and&mdash;ah, how many strange
faces would present themselves to her view in the
houses to which she was sent, on the sidewalks, and
in the street-cars, and who could tell that the one
she so longed to find might not be among them!</p>

<p>It was assigned to her to carry home the work she
had completed the night before, and when the late
hour arrived at which a fashionable lady might be supposed
ready to receive such a call she set out upon
the by no means agreeable errand.</p>

<p>The air was keen and cold, but the sun shone
brightly, and she found her walk of some half dozen
squares bracing and enjoyable.</p>

<p>It was to a very handsome residence in a fashionable
quarter of the city that she had been sent.</p>

<p>The servant who answered her ring left her standing
in the hall while he carried away the package
she had brought. Presently he returned with a request
that she would follow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Carrie wants you to see it tried on, so’s
you can fix it if ’tain’t all right,” he said.</p>

<p>He led her up a flight of marble stairs, broad and
low, with an elegantly-carved balustrade, and over
softly-carpeted floors to a richly-furnished boudoir,
where three young girls, in elegant morning dresses,
lounged upon the sofas, taking their ease as though
life had no serious duties for them and time were
given only to be frittered away.</p>

<p>Floy was conscious that the three pairs of eyes
were levelled at her on her entrance, but bore the
ordeal with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re the young person sent from Mrs.
Sharp’s, I presume?” said one, laying aside a novel.
“I’m glad she didn’t disappoint me. Will you please
undo it?” pointing to the parcel lying on an ottoman.
“I must try it on and let you see that it’s all
right before you go.”</p>

<p>She spoke as if addressing a menial, and Floy’s
cheek burned; but she silently did as requested.</p>

<p>The wrappings were removed, and in a moment all
three of the young ladies had started to their feet
with exclamations of “Lovely!” “Charming!”
“Exquisite!”</p>

<p>“I shall run into the next room and put it on!”
cried the owner.</p>

<p>“And I’ll help you, Carrie,” said one of the others.</p>

<p>“No, no, Bell, thank you! you and Laura stay here
and let me burst in upon you in full bloom,” she answered
laughingly. “But you may come,” nodding
graciously to Floy. “I’ll need your assistance. I’ll
carry this lovely over-skirt; you may bring the rest.”</p>

<p>The bedroom to which she conducted Floy was, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the richness and luxury of its furnishing, quite in
keeping with the boudoir.</p>

<p>The change of dress was quickly made, Floy adjusting
the rich folds of the new gown, and making
one or two little alterations in the looping or the
position of the flowers to suit the taste of the wearer.</p>

<p>“Wait here a moment while I show myself to my
friends,” said the latter when all was done.</p>

<p>She sailed away into the adjoining room, and Floy
heard the exclamations.</p>

<p>“Oh, charming, Carrie!”</p>

<p>“And so becoming! I declare, Cal, even Espy
Alden would find you irresistible in that!”</p>

<p>“Why not say Will? he’s to be here next week&mdash;coming
home with Fred to spend the holidays.
They’re college chums, you know.”</p>

<p>The light, joyous laugh that accompanied the
words seemed to say that she considered him as already
secured.</p>

<p>Floy heard it all, and a pang shot through her
heart.</p>

<p>Espy Alden! her own Espy! it could be no other,
for it was no common name.</p>

<p>Faint, giddy, sick at heart, trembling in every
limb, she dropped into a chair and hid her face in
her hands. She thought she had resigned him, yet
oh, what anguish that another should have won her
place in his heart!</p>

<p>No tears came to her burning eyes, but she was
half frightened at the pallor of her face as, on raising
her head again, she caught sight of it in a mirror on
the opposite wall. She hastily drew down her veil
to hide it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The talk was going on in the next room, and every
word came distinctly to her ear.</p>

<p>“What’s he like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you haven’t seen him, Bell? There, what
do you think of him? It’s not a bit flattered; is it,
Laura?”</p>

<p>“No; don’t do him justice. No photograph
could, for he’s much handsomer when he’s talking
and laughing than when his face is at rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, and he’s a splendid talker; quite an
artist too, Fred says. But now tell me if you think
all these flowers are disposed to the very best advantage.”</p>

<p>The rest of the chat was about the dress, and fell
utterly unheeded upon Floy’s ear.</p>

<p>An artist, so handsome, so good a conversationist&mdash;it
could be no other than her own Espy&mdash;hers
from her very babyhood. And this girl had his likeness&mdash;no
doubt given by himself. What could it
mean if not that they were betrothed? Well, what
right had she to blame him? None, none, for she
had voluntarily resigned him; and yet, and yet&mdash;oh,
her heart was like to break!</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? are you ill?” she heard a
voice asking at her side&mdash;the voice of the girl who
had won him from her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered faintly, “I&mdash;I’ve been up
very late for several nights; work is so pressing just
now, and I rose this morning with a terrible headache.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s too bad! I wouldn’t be a dressmaker
for anything in the world. Well, I suppose you’d
like to go, and there is no need for you to stay any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
longer. Tell Mrs. Sharp I’m delighted with the
dress. Have you the bill with you?”</p>

<p>Floy produced it, receipted and signed; the money
was paid, and she took her departure.</p>

<p>The keen, frosty air was no longer refreshing as
she retraced her steps; it seemed rather to chill her
to the very bones.</p>

<p>Hetty had asked her to come in through the store.
Some customers were just passing out as she reached
the door. Hetty glanced toward her on her entrance.</p>

<p>“Why, how dreadfully you look!” she exclaimed.
“I haven’t managed right. I shouldn’t have let you
go for such a walk when you’d eaten hardly a mouthful
of breakfast.”</p>

<p>She threw an arm about Floy’s waist as she spoke,
and drew her into a small room back of the store,
where the making and trimming of bonnets was carried
on. Several girls were working busily at the
end nearest the window.</p>

<p>“Sit down here by the register and warm yourself,”
said Hetty, gently forcing Floy into a large
arm-chair.</p>

<p>“No, no, I must go up to the work-room at once,”
answered the weary, half-fainting girl; “you know
all hands are needed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll just sit there till you’re well warmed and
have had a cup of tea,” said Hetty with authority.
“The Thorne is but just done his breakfast; there’s
a good fire in the kitchen, and&mdash;I’ll be back in two
seconds. Don’t you dare to move till I come.”
And shaking her finger threateningly, she rushed
away through a door opening into the dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Her promise was not fulfilled to the letter, but
scarce five minutes had elapsed when she returned
with a cup of fragrant tea and two or three slices of
thin, daintily browned and buttered toast, all fresh
from the fire.</p>

<p>The tray, covered with a snowy napkin, was
quickly placed on a stand close at Floy’s side, and
Hetty ordered her, in a tone of good-humored authority,
to eat and drink.</p>

<p>She tried to speak her thanks, but her lip trembled
and tears came instead of words.</p>

<p>“There, now, my dear, don’t emulate the folly of
Oliver Twist over his water-gruel,” said Hetty
jocosely. “I think you’ll find this fare somewhat
more tempting than his; but salt water won’t improve
it. You see,” bending low and speaking
in a whisper, “I’ve cribbed a little from the store of
dainties provided for the Thorne and served it upon
part of my own breakfast set, generally reserved for
high days and holidays. Now I must leave you, for
there’s a customer,” and she hurried into the store.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the tea was appetizing. Floy
tasted it, then broke off a bit of the toast, and presently
discovered that, whatever might have been the
original cause of her headache, an empty stomach
had not a little to do with it now.</p>

<p>The slight refreshment made it possible to force
herself to work, though in other and happier days
she would have been deemed too ill for any place but
bed.</p>

<p>The pain in the head was partially relieved, but that
of the heart remained unassuaged; and though it
cost a painful effort, it was perhaps well for her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
she was compelled to give her mind to the details of
her employment, cutting, fitting, and trimming
through all the long hours of the day and evening,
till nature was so thoroughly exhausted that sleep
came the moment she lay down to her rest, two
hours earlier than on the previous night&mdash;the result
of Hetty’s kindly interposition.</p>

<p>It was the same through the remainder of the
week; every day some errand to take her out for a
breath of fresh air, every night an hour or two added
to her time for rest; also her bed was removed to a
warmer and purer atmosphere, Mrs. Goodenough
and Hetty taking her into their room, which was
heated by a furnace in the cellar and was better ventilated
than the crowded room overhead.</p>

<p>Floy was very grateful, especially when the added
luxury of some degree of privacy was given her by
the kindness of Mrs. Goodenough in curtaining off
the corner where her bed was placed.</p>

<p>The beneficial effect of these changes was soon
apparent in Floy’s increased appetite and brighter
looks.</p>

<p>On the ensuing Sabbath she felt herself able to go
to church, which had been the case only once before
since her coming to the city, all the other Sundays
finding her so worn out with the week’s work
as to be compelled to spend the day in sleeping off
her exhaustion.</p>

<p>She went alone; and not wishing to attract observation,
slipped quietly into a pew near the door.</p>

<p>The services had not yet begun, and her thoughts
had flown far away to the dear ones worshipping in
the upper sanctuary, when suddenly they were recalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to earth. A rustle of silk, and three gayly-dressed
young girls swept up the aisle closely followed
by two young men, the foremost, Espy Alden,
stepping so close in passing that she could
easily have laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>Her heart gave a wild bound as she recognized
him, but he did not see her.</p>

<p>She said to herself she was glad of it, yet it pained
her to her heart’s core. Had he no eyes for any one
but Miss Carrie Lea? Surely if his heart were
loyal as of yore to his first love, he would have felt
her presence near. It had seemed ever so in those
earlier days.</p>

<p>He sat where she could see his side face, and many
a furtive glance fed her hunger for the old love, a
consuming fire that pride&mdash;her woman’s pride&mdash;vainly
strove to trample out. Ah, it was the only
earthly love left her, and it had been so sweet!</p>

</div>

<p>The moment the benediction was pronounced
Floy left the church and walked rapidly away,
turning the first corner she came to, nor paused nor
slackened her pace till she reached Mrs. Sharp’s
door.</p>

<p>“Had you a good sermon?” queried Hetty at
the dinner-table.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Floy answered absently.</p>

<p>“It does not seem to have refreshed you much,”
sneered Mr. Sharp, with a keen glance at the pale,
sorrowful face whereon the traces of tears were very
evident. “I would prescribe a nap instead, next
Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tease her, Thorne,” said Mrs. Goodenough,
“she’s been trying to do her duty like a
Christian. What is it Shakespeare says?”</p>

<p>“Madam, let me counsel you to purchase a copy
of the works of that immortal bard, and study it for
your own edification, for ours, and for that of the
world at large,” he returned loftily and with a contemptuous
wave of the hand, as he passed his cup to
be refilled.</p>

<p>Hetty flushed indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>“It might be for your edification, no doubt,” she
retorted; “this passage for one&mdash;‘Conceit in weakest
bodies strongest works.’”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush, child! that’s too strong,” said her
mother, taking the cup. “But unasked advice isn’t
apt to be welcome, Thorne; what is it Shakespeare
says?” and the tea-pot she had just lifted was set
down again while she seemed lost in contemplation.
“Ah! I have it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i8">“‘I pray thee cease thy counsel,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Which falls into mine ears as profitless</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">As water in a sieve.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Sharp rose, and, pushing his plate angrily
away, strode from the room. Mrs. Sharp looked annoyed,
but made no remark, contenting herself with
a reproachful glance at her sister and niece.</p>

<p>Hetty accepted her share with extreme nonchalance.
As for the other delinquent, she was too
much elated by her successful quotation to heed so
trifling a matter as the passing displeasure of her
sister&mdash;a displeasure, too, which, as she shrewdly
suspected, was more than half assumed for the mere
sake of appearance.</p>

<p>That was the fact, and yet there was a real vexation
to Mrs. Sharp in what had occurred, because
she would have to bear the brunt of his ill-humor.</p>

<p>With that unpleasant conviction weighing upon
her, she breathed a heavy sigh as she, too, left the
table and the room.</p>

<p>“Poor Aunt Prue!” said Hetty, looking after her.
“What a sad misnomer was her name when she undertook
the care and support of&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush, hush, child!” interrupted her mother.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I must try to keep my opinions to
myself,” pursued the girl, with a serio-comic expression,
“but I can’t help feeling sorry for her,
or glad for ourselves, that we’ll get no more Sharp
prickles from the Thorne to-day. He’s bound to
spend the rest of it in a fit o’ the pouts, and will not
darken these doors till noon of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp found her Thorne lying on a couch in
their chamber, literally pouting like the great baby
that he was.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said soothingly, “you mustn’t
mind that saucy girl; she isn’t worth it, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not; but if you cared a penny
for me you’d send her away at once, or rather
would have done so long ago.”</p>

<p>“But, unfortunately, Thorne, we can’t do without
her, and, still more unfortunately, she is perfectly
aware of the fact, and doesn’t scruple to take every
advantage of it.”</p>

<p>“‘Where there’s a will there’s a way,’ Mrs. Sharp,
and if you were the right sort of wife you’d never sit
by and see your husband insulted at his own table
as I have been to-day.”</p>

<p>“His own table indeed!” thought she; “it’s
more Hetty’s than his; more mine than hers. But&mdash;ah,
well, I must even make the best of a bad bargain.”</p>

<p>And going into an adjoining room, she presently
returned laden with delicacies&mdash;fine confections and
tropical fruits&mdash;which she pressed upon him, saying,
“You made such a poor dinner; hardly eat enough
to keep a bird alive; do try to eke it out with these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
These grapes are splendid, so are the oranges and
bananas, and I never saw finer candies.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them,” he said shortly; “if things
are to be locked up and kept from my knowledge till
it suits you to bring them out, I’ll not touch them.”</p>

<p>At this she was justly indignant, and, losing all patience,
informed him that “since he was determined
to ‘bite off his nose to spite his face’ he was entirely
welcome to do so.”</p>

<p>“To think that I should ever have married a woman
who can use such vulgarisms as that!” said he,
turning his back on her.</p>

<p>“Better be vulgar than wicked!” she retorted,
“and the way you’re behaving is downright wicked&mdash;such
temper and ingratitude! If you were a
child I should say you wanted a good spanking, and
I rather think so as it is. If I were you I’d really
try to put away childish things.”</p>

<p>“You, who can be guilty of such extravagance as
this, do well to reprove me, your liege lord,” he
remarked with bitter sarcasm. “Cast the beam from
your own eye, and you may perhaps see clearly to
pull the mote out of mine.”</p>

<p>“My liege lord indeed!” she repeated scornfully;
“rather my&mdash; But I will not bandy words with
you, and, lest I should be too strongly tempted to do
so, shall leave you to pout it out alone.”</p>

<p>So saying, she gathered up her rejected dainties and
swept from the room, leaving him to repent of his
refusal at leisure, for no child could be fonder of
sweets than he.</p>

<p>All that day and the succeeding night Espy was
present in Floy’s dreams whether sleeping or waking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Nor were they happy dreams, for they seemed to
take him farther and farther from her. Yet she
strove to be cheerful in the presence of others, and
only Hetty suspected how hollow was the pretence.
Monday passed by, bringing no unusual event. On
Tuesday, at a late hour in the morning, she was again
directed to go to the residence of the Leas; this
time to fit a dress for Carrie’s mother.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lea is not quite ready for you yet, miss,”
said the servant who answered her ring. “She
says you’ll be so good as to wait till she sends for
you. Just walk in here, please,” he added on his
own responsibility, perceiving that he was addressing
a lady, and throwing open the door of the library
as he spoke.</p>

<p>Floy stepped in, the door closing behind her, and
instantly became aware that the room had an occupant,
and only one&mdash;a young and handsome man,
seated comfortably in an easy chair by the fire, and
busied with the morning paper.</p>

<p>He looked up; the paper was suddenly flung aside,
and in an instant he had caught both her hands in
his, his face all aglow with delighted surprise.</p>

<p>“Floy, Floy! have I found you at last? Oh,
darling, can you, will you forgive those cruel words
of mine? Ah, if you knew how bitterly they have
been repented!”</p>

<p>It was her own Espy again. Tears of joy rained
down her cheeks; she could not speak for emotion;
but she did not repulse him as he took her in his
arms and folded her to his heart with many a tender
caress, whispering the while, “Floy, Floy! my own
darling, my own little wife!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no, not that!” she sobbed. “Oh, Espy,
Espy, we must part!”</p>

<p>“For a little while&mdash;only for a little while&mdash;dearest.”</p>

<p>“Your parents&mdash;have they relented?” she asked,
wiping the tears from her eyes and gazing steadily
into his.</p>

<p>His cheek flushed.</p>

<p>“I shall be of age in a few weeks, and be my own
master,” he said, drawing himself up proudly.</p>

<p>“But not mine,” she said very low&mdash;so low that
he scarcely caught the words&mdash;and gently releasing
herself from his embrace.</p>

<p>He flushed more hotly than before. “Oh, Floy,
have I ever seemed to think it? Nay, have I not
rather been your devoted slave?”</p>

<p>“You were always good to me, Espy; always
watching over and caring for me, and ready and anxious
to give me the best of everything. Oh, I shall
never, never forget your goodness! no, not even if&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If what, Floy?”</p>

<p>“Even though another has&mdash;has won you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, never!” he cried, taking her hands
again. “I never have, never can love any one but
you. Why should you think it?” and he gazed
searchingly into her eyes.</p>

<p>Then she told him something of what she had involuntarily
heard a few days previous while waiting
in Carrie Lea’s bedroom.</p>

<p>He was indignant and evidently surprised to learn
that the girl had his photograph; puzzled, too, to
conjecture how it had come into her possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must have been somehow through her brother,”
he said after a moment’s thought. “But,
Floy, I have never paid her any particular attention,”
he added with deprecating look and tone.</p>

<p>“I believe you fully, Espy,” she replied, with a
confiding smile; “but since I have released you
from your engagement to me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not accept my release,” he interrupted impulsively,
“and that being the case, I am answerable
to you for my conduct toward other women.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and was opening her lips to
speak again, when the sound of approaching steps
prevented. She drew hastily away from Espy’s side,
and, seating herself by a window, seemed to have her
attention fully occupied with something that was
going on in the street.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>“Miss, Mrs. Lea says you’ll please walk up now
to her dressing-room.”</p>

<p>Espy, standing before the grate with his back to
the door, turned at the words and made a stride
forward, his face blazing with indignation, but only
to see Floy’s black skirt vanish through the door,
which instantly closed between them.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” he asked himself half
aloud; “I thought she was merely making a morning
call, but that fellow spoke to her as if she were
a menial like himself.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of light laughter and gay
girlish voices on the stairway, and in the hall without,
the door again opened, and the smiling face of
Miss Carrie Lea looked in.</p>

<p>“The sleigh’s at the door, Mr. Alden, and we’re all
ready waiting for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>He had engaged to drive out with the ladies at
that hour in Mr. Lea’s fine sleigh, behind his handsome,
spirited bays; and anxious though he was beyond
expression to snatch another interview with
Floy by intercepting her as she should leave the
house, he felt compelled to go, not being able on the
spur of the moment to think of any plausible excuse.</p>

<p>Since there was no alternative, he made the best of
it; with smile and jest handed the ladies to their
places, tucked the buffalo-robes carefully about
them, took his seat by Carrie Lea’s side, and drove
off, fervently hoping that something would occur to
cause a speedy return.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Lea’s dressing-room was gorgeous with crimson
and gold; they were the prominent colors of its
adornment, from the velvet carpet on the floor to the
gayly-frescoed ceiling.</p>

<p>The lady herself, arrayed in a morning robe of dark
blue silk, and wearing a great quantity of heavy
jewelry, reclined upon a crimson-satin-covered couch.
She evidently belonged to the shoddy aristocracy,
and her sallow, slightly-wrinkled face expressed
nothing but supercilious pride and fretful discontent.</p>

<p>She greeted Floy with an angry nod and the question:
“What’s the reason Mrs. Sharp sends you instead
of coming herself? You can tell her I don’t
like such treatment, and I consider that my money
is as good as any other body’s. She says in her note
you can fit as well as she can; but I don’t believe
it; it stands to reason that a ’prentice-girl couldn’t
do as well as her mistress.”</p>

<p>Floy’s cheek flushed, but she stood with an air of
dignity, silently waiting for the end of the tirade,
then quietly asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Am I to fit your dress, Mrs. Lea?”</p>

<p>“Can you? that’s the question.”</p>

<p>“You have Mrs. Sharp’s opinion in regard to my
ability. I can only say that I am ready to do my
best, or to return to her with your message, as you
please.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you may cut and fit the lining,
and I can judge by the looks of it whether to allow
you to go on and do up the job. Eliza,” turning to
her maid, “bring the things. You know where they
are.”</p>

<p>Floy had not been invited to sit down, but feeling
ill able to stand, quietly took possession of the
nearest chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lea elevated her eyebrows and muttered
something angrily about “impudence and upstarts,
and some folks making themselves very much at
home in other folks’ houses.”</p>

<p>Floy seemed not to hear, but kept her seat till the
maid returned with the required articles, and Mrs.
Lea was ready to stand up and be fitted.</p>

<p>This proved a tedious and trying process to both,
by reason of Mrs. Lea’s impatience and captiousness;
but at length Floy’s efforts resulted in so signal
a success that she was graciously permitted, in
Mrs. Lea’s phrase, “to go on and do up the job.”</p>

<p>“Why, it fits elegant!” she exclaimed at the final
trying on. “I declare Mrs. Sharp couldn’t a done it
better herself, and you may tell her I said as much.”</p>

<p>Floy was gratified, for the Leas were among Mrs.
Sharp’s best customers. Her patience and forbearance
had been sorely tried, but had not failed, and
now she was rewarded for the restraint put upon
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Her pulses quickened as she passed the library
door in going out, though she knew Espy was not
there now, for she had heard the departure of the
sleighing party, and they had not returned.</p>

<p>Another hour had slipped away before they came,
and Espy was met at the door by a telegram to the
effect that his mother was lying dangerously ill,
and he must hasten home without delay if he would
see her alive.</p>

<p>Espy read it at a glance; and turning a pale, agitated
countenance upon the servant, who stood
waiting,</p>

<p>“I must be gone at once,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I expected as much, and I’ve packed
your valise, sir; here it is all right&mdash;everything in
it that you’d left in your room.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; it was very thoughtful and kind. I
will have to leave my adieus to the ladies and gentlemen
with you. Tell them I have been suddenly
summoned home. My mother is very ill, and I shall
have barely time to catch the train. Good-by.”</p>

<p>And dropping a dollar into the man’s hand, Espy
seized the valise and rushed away in hot pursuit of a
passing street-car.</p>

<p>Even at that moment of grief, anxiety, and haste,
he remembered with a sharp pang that this sudden
departure robbed him of the opportunity to obtain
another interview with Floy or to learn her address.</p>

<p>During the two hours’ drive his thoughts had been
so full of her, their late interview, and plans for
securing another, that he found no little difficulty in
attending to the small talk of his companions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
was more than once rallied by them upon his absence
of mind.</p>

<p>It was the more annoying since he was the only
gentleman of the party, young Lea being confined
to his room that day with a severe cold.</p>

<p>Great were the chagrin and disappointment of
Carrie when she heard of Espy’s abrupt departure.
The others cared less, as she had managed to monopolize
almost all his attentions.</p>

<p>Floy’s heart meanwhile was in a tumult of
mingled emotions&mdash;joy that she had heard from
Espy’s own lips the assurance of his faithfulness to
her, sorrow that duty seemed still to forbid their
betrothment.</p>

<p>Well was it for her in those days that necessity
compelled her to constant employment, and that
much thought had to be given to her work.</p>

<p>The diversion of her mind from her cares and
griefs was further assisted by the occurrences of the
next day.</p>

<p>It was two hours since the early breakfast at Mrs.
Sharp’s, and in the work-room all was life, activity,
and bustle: the buzz of three sewing-machines, the
busy hum of voices giving and asking instructions,
the click of the scissors cutting out garments and
their trimmings, making a confusion of sounds.</p>

<p>Floy, putting the finishing touches to the rich silk
she had fitted yesterday for Mrs. Lea, was wondering
if she should be commissioned to carry home this
dress, her heart trembling with mingled pleasure
and pain at thought of a possible meeting with Espy
if sent upon that errand.</p>

<p>A loud peal from the door-bell made her start,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and set all her nerves tingling, she scarce knew
why.</p>

<p>“The postman,” said Mrs. Sharp; “more orders,
I presume. Here, give it to me, Patsy,” as the
little maid appeared with a note in her hand.
“Yes, just as I thought. Run back to your work,
Patsy. No, make yourself decent first; I won’t
have customers driven away by such a fright answering
the bell.”</p>

<p>With the open note in her hand, Mrs. Sharp hurried
into the store to consult with Hetty.</p>

<p>“Here’s a note from the Madame&mdash;wanting a
dress fitted to-day, and made this week; with all
this holiday work on our hands, giving us hardly
time to breathe! But it’s like her&mdash;always choosing
my busiest time. Did you ever know it to fail?”</p>

<p>“Never! so we ought to be used to it by this
time.”</p>

<p>“What do you advise?”</p>

<p>“Madame is too valuable a customer to lose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I’d send Floy. No one else is competent except
yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; yes, she’ll have to go, though I
don’t know how to spare her here.”</p>

<p>Hastening back to the work-room,</p>

<p>“Is that dress done, Miss Kemper?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m just setting the last stitches,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, the minute you’re done put on your
things and take it home; then go on from there to
the address I shall give you. She’s a good customer&mdash;rich,
middle-aged, queer, and must be humored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in her notions. She thinks she must have a
new dress immediately, though she has fifty already.
You’ll probably have to stay two or three days,
as she will have her gowns made in the house, and
a great deal of work put on them.”</p>

<p>Floy obeyed, nothing loath, for she was weary
enough of the monotony of her life and the disorder,
hurry, and bustle of the work-room.</p>

<p>“Any change,” thought she, “must surely be for
the better.”</p>

<p>As she passed though the hall at Mr. Lea’s, after
attending to her errand, she overheard the inquiry
of a gentleman at the door for Mr. Alden, and the
servant’s reply,</p>

<p>“He’s left the city, sir; went off yesterday in a
mighty big hurry. Had a telegram that somebody
was sick at home.”</p>

<p>The words went through Floy like a shot. For
an instant she was near falling, but recovering herself,
she hastily drew down her veil and stepped past
the servant into the street.</p>

<p>The gentleman was already gone, and she too
went quietly on her way&mdash;seeming quiet outwardly,
but in great tumult of feeling.</p>

<p>“Was it Espy’s father who was so ill? Would he
now relent? Would he die?”</p>

<p>In either case the bar to her own and Espy’s happiness
would be removed. She was horrified at the
thrill of pleasure that thought brought with it: that
she could be glad of the death of another! Silently
asking forgiveness, cleansing, help, she hurried onward.</p>

<p>There was now neither hope nor fear of meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Espy. Was she glad? was she sorry? Truly she
did not know. Then she thought of him bereaved
of a parent, and her tears fell fast. Who knew better
than she the anguish of such a loss? Ah, if she
could but save him this great sorrow!</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte lived in the suburbs of the city
in a large, handsome dwelling on the shore of the
lake, of which there was a fine view from the
whole front of the house. The street-cars, however,
carried Floy to within a square of the place,
and it was still comparatively early when she
reached it.</p>

<p>Her ring was promptly answered by a pretty,
neatly-attired Irish girl, rosy and smiling.</p>

<p>“Is it the dressmaker from Mrs. Sharp’s that the
Madame’s expecting?” she inquired without waiting
for Floy to tell her errand. “Well, I’m glad to see
you, miss, for you’ve a purty face, and are a nice-lookin’
lady intirely, besides that the Madame would
a been awful vexed if you’d disappointed her. But
just step this way, intil the dining-room; for the
Madame’s not up yet&mdash;she don’t rise mostly afore
nine o’clock&mdash;and me orders was to give you your
breakfast the first thing.”</p>

<p>“I have breakfasted, thank you, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, but sure don’t we all know what onchristian
hours they kape down there? giving ye
yere breakfast afore six o’clock. An’ sure ye’ve
been walkin’ and ridin’ in the cowld, keen air o’ the
streets till folks would think ye’d be as hungry as a
wolf.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, she led the way through the great
wide hall with its broad staircase, past open doors that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
gave glimpses of spacious, elegantly-furnished apartments,
to a cosey, sunshiny breakfast-parlor, where a
glowing grate, with an easy chair beside it and a little
round table daintily spread with snowy drapery,
cut glass, silver, and Sevres china, and set in a large
bay window where some rare plants were blooming,
and whence could be caught a view of the rolling
waters of the lake, were very suggestive of ease and
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“There, miss, wad ye ax a swater place to eat
in?” queried Kathleen, watching with delight Floy’s
face brighten with pleased surprise as she glanced
from side to side of the cheery room.</p>

<p>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s meself that wouldn’t. Now just sit ye
down in that big chair by the fire and take off your
things and warm yerself while I fetch in the breakfast.”</p>

<p>Very willingly Floy accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>“A very pleasant beginning,” she thought as she
felt the genial warmth of the fire; “the Madame
must be both kind and generous. But I must not
expect to find roses without thorns anywhere in
this world; ah, no! but I will try to take quietly
and thankfully the sweet and bitter as they come.”</p>

<p>There was no bitter in the breakfast presently
served by the smiling Kathleen: fragrant, delicious
coffee, richly creamed and sugared; the sweetest of
butter, elegant hot rolls, a tender beefsteak&mdash;all
done to a turn.</p>

<p>Floy had not thought of hunger till food was
offered her, but to her surprise found no lack of appetite
for the tempting fare set before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>She had hardly begun her meal when, at a whining
sound, Kathleen opened the door leading into the
hall and admitted a curly lap-dog as white as snow,
a beautiful little creature.</p>

<p>“Why, Frisky, you’re late till yere breakfast the
day!” said Kathleen, stroking it gently. “See,
miss, isn’t he a purty crayther? his coat’s so fine
and soft and glossy!”</p>

<p>“Like floss silk,” said Floy. “Is he the Madame’s
pet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, that he is, the darlint! an’ we all
make much of him, an’ it’s spoilt he is intirely, the
crayther. He’s come fur his breakfast, miss; he’s
been used to ating in here with his misthress, an’
niver a bit will he ate in the kitchen, such a grand
gintleman as he is; so will ye plaze to excuse us
if I bring his mate in here and feed him afore ye?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” returned Floy, with a smile. “I
should like to see him eat.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, miss,” said Kathleen, setting two
more chairs up to the table, of one of which Frisky
instantly took possession, then whisking into the
kitchen and back again, bringing a plate of meat
quite as carefully prepared as the one she had set before
Floy.</p>

<p>“You see it’s kapin’ it hot for him I’ve been,
miss,” she explained, seating herself in the other
chair and beginning to cut the meat up into small bits.
“It must be hot, and cut fine, or he won’t touch it;
and, more nor that, he’ll not ate a mouthful if ye
don’t sing to him all the time.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed her listener in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, it’s thrue as prachin’; just see now!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
we always have to feed him wid a silver fork too.”
And taking up a bit in her fingers she offered it, saying
coaxingly, “Ate it now, me jewel; it’s illegant,
tender, and swate.”</p>

<p>He did not so much as sniff at it, but looked her
steadily in the face, with a little growl, as much as to
say, “Do you mean to insult me?”</p>

<p>She began to sing, still holding the bit of meat in
her fingers and bringing it a little nearer to his
nose.</p>

<p>He snapped at her with a short, sharp bark, and,
laughing, she took up another piece with a silver
fork, and silently offered it.</p>

<p>He only repeated his growl.</p>

<p>She began her song again, still holding out the
piece on the fork, and he took it at once and devoured
it greedily.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a comely woman, older and
more staid in appearance than the merry, talkative
Kathleen, came in, asking in a tone of irritation,</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here? what are you doing to
Madame’s pet? she sent me down to see if he was
getting abused.”</p>

<p>“Niver a bit at all, at all, Mary, me dear; sure
an’ it’s mesilf that likes the little baste wid it’s cunnin’
thricks too well to abuse it, let alone that I’d
niver hurt a livin’ crayther. Och, ye varmint! take
it, will yees?” offering another choice morsel; “can’t
yer see with half an eye that even the like o’ me
can’t talk an’ sing both at onct? It’s worse than a
babby yees are! Tra, la, la, la, la la!”</p>

<p>“Ten times worse!” observed the older woman
testily, “but nothing to compare to his mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
she’s more trouble than forty babies; never a wink
o’ sleep do I git till long after midnight.”</p>

<p>“An’ do ye think, Mary, me dear, it’s much slape
ye’d get wid forty babbies to the fore?” queried
Kathleen, ceasing her song for a moment. “But
I’m forgetting me manners. It’s the young lady
that’s come to make the Madame’s dress, Mary,” she
added, with a nod of her head in Floy’s direction.</p>

<p>“How do you do, miss?” said Mary civilly.
“Don’t be discouraged at what I’ve been saying;
the Madame has her good points as well as other
folks; you’ll find her unreasonable and hard to
please sometimes, but she’ll make it up to you; she’s
very generous and free with her money.”</p>

<p>In reply Floy, having finished her meal, intimated
that she would like to get to work at once.</p>

<p>“Then come with me; I’ll take you to the sewing-room
and give you the skirts to work at till Madame
is pleased to be fitted,” returned Mary, leading
the way.</p>

<p>This, too, was a bright, cheery, prettily-furnished
room, and Floy was not sorry to be left alone in it
for the next hour. Quietness and solitude had become
rare luxuries in the busy, crowded life of the
homeless young orphan.</p>

<p>How quiet the house was! were there no children
in it? No, surely only a childless woman could be
so foolishly fond of an animal as this Madame evidently
was.</p>

<p>No wonder Floy found the house so quiet. Madame’s
dressing-room, adjoining the one where she
sat, was tenantless, the lady herself sleeping soundly
in the bedroom beyond, Frisky curled up by her side,
and Mary dozing on a sofa near by, while Kathleen
had locked up her kitchen and gone out upon some
household errand.</p>

<p>As the clock on the mantel struck ten Madame
awoke.</p>

<p>“Mary!” she called plaintively, “Mary, why did
you let me sleep so long?”</p>

<p>“Because if I had not you would have reproved
me for waking you,” returned the maid, shaking off
her drowsiness and assuming a sitting posture upon
the sofa.</p>

<p>“Mary, you are impolite, not to say unkind and
disrespectful, to answer me so,” whimpered the mistress,
applying a handkerchief to her eyes. “You
don’t appreciate all I do for you. It isn’t every girl
that can live in the luxury you do&mdash;fed and clothed
like a lady&mdash;and lay by her five or six dollars every
week too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s true enough, Madame; but I’m sure I
earn it all, and you know as well as I that you
couldn’t get anybody else to serve you as much to
your liking for twice the money. What will you be
pleased to have for your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” returned Madame, sobbing behind
her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“How will you have it prepared?” asked Mary
with unmoved gravity.</p>

<p>Madame burst into a laugh. “I’ll have a broiled
sweet-bread, hot buttered muffins, coffee, and marmalade.”</p>

<p>“Shall I prepare it?”</p>

<p>“No, ring for Kathleen.”</p>

<p>Mary touched the bell.</p>

<p>“What gown will Madame be pleased to wear?”
she asked, bringing a basin of water and a towel to
the bedside.</p>

<p>“That blue silk wrapper. Has Mrs. Sharp come?”</p>

<p>“No, but she has sent a young girl to work for
you. I left her in the sewing-room making your
skirts.”</p>

<p>“The top o’ the mornin’ to yees, Madame!” cried
Kathleen, coming in fresh and rosy from her walk.
“I hope ye’re aisy, an’ feel like atin’ a big breakfast.
Ye breathe aisier nor ye do sometimes.”</p>

<p>Madame was seized at that moment with a wheezing
asthmatic cough.</p>

<p>“I had a bad night,” she said pantingly, “and
have no breath to spare. Tell her what to get me,
Mary.”</p>

<p>Thirty years ago Madame Le Conte was a slender,
graceful girl, with a clear olive complexion, delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
features, ruby lips, bright black eyes, and lively,
engaging manners; now she was an overgrown,
gross-looking, middle-aged, or rather elderly, woman,
immensely fat, tortured with asthma, gout and sundry
kindred ailments, dull, heavy, and uninteresting,
nervous, irritable, childishly unreasonable and
changeable, full of whims and fancies&mdash;a wretched
burden to herself and all about her.</p>

<p>Rolling in wealth, she constantly sighed over the
sad fact that there were none of her own kith and
kin to inherit it, and that the service rendered her
was not the service of love, but merely of self-interest.</p>

<p>Mary, her personal attendant, had been with her
many years, thoroughly understood her ways, and
knew how to minister to her wants as no one else
did; and quite aware of the fact, sometimes took
advantage of it to scold her mistress when much
tried by her unreasonable demands, threatening to
leave, and occasionally even refusing to obey orders,
when Madame would angrily dismiss her, but on being
seemingly taken at her word, would relent, burst
into tears and pathetic entreaties, and buy a reconciliation
with fair promises, increased wages, or expensive
presents.</p>

<p>Madame wore a cork hand; how she had come
to be deprived of her good right hand no one
knew or dared ask, for she was extremely sensitive
in regard to her loss, and would not endure
the slightest allusion to it. Mary removed the artificial
limb at night and replaced it in the morning
without question or comment, and made it part of
her business to divert the idle curiosity of others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
from this deformity of her mistress. This she did
without waiting for instructions; for Mary had a
heart, and often pitied the poor rich cripple from its
very depths.</p>

<p>“Yes, she had a bad night, so don’t make her talk
any more,” she said to Kathleen as she carefully
laved her mistress’s face and hand. “She’ll have a
broiled sweet-bread&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, let it be stewed; I’ll have it stewed,”
interrupted the Madame.</p>

<p>Mary completed the bill of fare as given by her
mistress a few moments before, and Kathleen turned
to go, but had scarcely reached the door when she
was called back.</p>

<p>“Waffles, waffles, Katty,” wheezed her mistress.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; and muffins too?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes, yes. Go, and make haste; I’m
starved.”</p>

<p>Kathleen had reached the head of the stairs when
she was again recalled, and tea and cream-toast substituted
for coffee, muffins, and waffles; then the
Madame thought she would prefer chocolate, and
finally decided that all three should be prepared, toast
and muffins also, and she would take her choice.</p>

<p>Even Kathleen’s almost imperturbable good-nature
was somewhat tried. Her face clouded for a
moment, but all was sunshine ere she reached her
kitchen again, where she flew nimbly about, executing
the latest orders of her capricious mistress, saying
laughingly to herself:</p>

<p>“Sure an’ it’s me that ’ud better make haste afore
she has time to change her mind again; for it won’t
be long it’ll take her to do that same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a knock at the side gate, and Kathleen
flew to open it, the rose on her cheek deepening and
her pretty blue eyes dancing with delight.</p>

<p>“It’s only me, Kathleen, me darlint!” cried a
cheery voice.</p>

<p>“Sure and don’t I know your knock, Rory?” she
responded, drawing back the bolt and admitting a
strapping young Irishman. “But come into the
kitchen; I’ve got the Madame’s breakfast over the
fire, and can’t stop here to spake two words to ye,”
she added, running back, he following close at her
heels.</p>

<p>“Has the Madame sint down her orders yet?” he
asked, sitting down beside the fire and watching the
girl’s movements with admiring eyes.</p>

<p>“No; she’s just up, and I’m thinking the horses’ll
be likely to rest till after dinner anyhow, for she’s
got a dressmaker at work makin’ up that illegant silk
she bought yesterday, and she’ll be wantin’ to get fit,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Av coorse. Well, I’m contint, since me wages
goes on all the same, an’ maybe I’ll have the more
time to sit here with you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, and maybe not,” said Kathleen,
turning her muffins; “they’ll maybe be wantin’ me
up there to run the machine.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was to make a silk gown for yersilf,
jewel; the Madame’s got a plinty now, and all the
fine dresses as iver was made couldn’t make her look
half as purty as you do in that nate calico. Things
isn’t avenly divided in this world, Kathleen, mavourneen.”</p>

<p>“Sure now, Rory, the good things isn’t all on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
side, afther all,” returned Kathleen, laughing.
“Wouldn’t the Madame give all her fine dresses, and
silver and goold too, for my health and strength or
yours?”</p>

<p>“That she would; or for your illegant figger and
purty skin that’s just like lilies and roses, and your
eyes that shine brighter than her diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Whist!” cried Kathleen, hastily lifting her
coffee-pot from the fire just as Mary opened the
dining-room door with the query:</p>

<p>“Is breakfast ready?”</p>

<p>“Everything’s done to a turn,” said Kathleen.
“And here’s Rory ready to carry it up, if ye like.”</p>

<p>“No, she has changed her mind; she’ll eat in the
breakfast-room. Rory’s to bring her down in the
elevator, and take her up again in it when she’s
done.”</p>

<p>When Madame had duly discussed her breakfast,
and recovered breath after her ascent to her private
apartments, Floy was summoned to her presence.</p>

<p>The young girl came quietly into the dressing-room,
where the lady reclined in a large easy chair.</p>

<p>Madame started at sight of her, uttering a low exclamation.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she asked, her voice trembling a
little as she spoke, “and what is your name?”</p>

<p>“I am one of Mrs. Sharp’s apprentices, and my
name is Florence Kemper. I have cut and basted
the lining of your dress; shall I fit it on you now?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no; Mary will put it on me and see if it is
all right. Mary knows my ways.”</p>

<p>Madame’s tone was still agitated, and she seemed
flurried and uneasy under Floy’s glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl noted it, and with true delicacy turned
her eyes in another direction while Mary performed
the required service.</p>

<p>Madame stood up before the glass. “I think it
fits, Mary, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think not quite. Shall Miss Kemper look at
it?”</p>

<p>Madame assented, and Floy’s nimble fingers were
presently busied about her, she meanwhile earnestly
regarding the reflection of the young face in the
glass.</p>

<p>It seemed to have far more interest for her than
the fit of the new gown, though ordinarily she was
eager as a child in regard to any new article of dress.</p>

<p>“Does it satisfy you now, Madame?” asked Floy
at length.</p>

<p>The Madame started as if waking from a dream,
glanced at the image of her own portly figure, and
responded with a hasty “Yes, yes, it is all right!
Child, you look tired, wretchedly tired&mdash;almost ill.
You must rest. Sit down in that chair, and Mary
shall bring you some refreshments.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, but I have no time for rest; these
are busy days for dressmakers,” Floy answered,
with a sad smile, thinking of the piles of dress patterns
still untouched, and garments in various stages
of completion, in Mrs. Sharp’s work-room.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” repeated the Madame, with an imperious
gesture; “I am used to obedience from all in
this house. Just slip my wrapper on again, Mary,
and then go to my closet and bring out all the good
things you can find.”</p>

<p>Mary obeyed, nothing loath, for she too felt drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to the young stranger, and Floy presently had spread
before her a tempting variety of cakes, confectionery,
and tropical fruits.</p>

<p>In vain she protested that she was not hungry;
Madame would not be content till she had seen her
eat an orange and a bunch of grapes, and put a paper
of candies into her pocket.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day the Madame insisted upon
occupying an easy chair in the sewing-room, where,
with Frisky curled up in her lap and the latest novel
in her hand, she furtively watched Floy’s movements,
and when she spoke, listened with ill-concealed
eagerness to every tone of her voice.</p>

<p>Floy, whose thoughts were far away, was scarcely
conscious of this strange interest taken in her, but
Mary noted it with wonder and growing curiosity
shared by Kathleen, who had been, as she anticipated,
summoned to the work of running the machine.
They telegraphed each other with nods, winks, and
smiles, neither the Madame nor Floy perceiving.</p>

<p>“The sun has set, and it is growing dark,” remarked
the Madame, closing her book and breaking
in on a long silence. “You are straining your eyes
in your efforts to thread that needle, Miss Kemper.
Come, put up your work and rest a little, while Mary
and Kathleen prepare our tea.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Madame,” said Floy, “but Mrs.
Sharp would not approve of so early a rest, and if I
may have a light I will go on with the work.”</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! <em>I’m</em> mistress here, and I’ll have no
such overwork!” was the quick, imperative rejoinder.
“I’ll make it right with Mrs. Sharp, paying
for the time all the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Floy submitted, repeating her thanks, for to the
over-strained eyes and weary frame a little rest was
most refreshing.</p>

<p>The work was neatly folded and laid aside. Mary
and Kathleen tidied the room, gathering up the
shreds of silk and lining, and putting things in
place; then receiving orders from Madame for a delicious
little supper to be served in her dressing-room
for Floy and herself, they went down to prepare
it.</p>

<p>A bright fire in an open grate filled the room with
ruddy light, and Floy was glad that the Madame refused
to have any other for the present.</p>

<p>Very sad, very quiet the young girl felt, thinking
of Espy and his sorrow; and taking, in obedience to
her employer’s direction, an easy chair by the window,
she gazed out musingly upon the lake, whose
dark, restless waters were now faintly illumined
by a line of silver light along the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>“The moon’s about to rise,” wheezed her companion.
“I like to watch it as it seems to come up
out of the water. Did you ever see it?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame,” returned the girl, smiling slightly,
“Mrs. Sharp’s apprentices have little time or opportunity
to observe the beauties of nature.”</p>

<p>“But Sundays&mdash;you do not work then?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame, but they find me weary enough to
go very early to bed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, too bad, too bad! But look, look! what a
shame to be deprived of so lovely a sight as that!”
cried the Madame as the queen of night suddenly
emerged from her watery bed, flooding the whole
scene with mellow radiance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is very beautiful,” murmured Floy, sighing
softly to herself.</p>

<p>How often in the happy days gone by she and
Espy had enjoyed the moonlight together!</p>

<p>“I would not stay there if I were you,” pursued
the Madame. “Why should you stay where you are
so badly treated? Why should any one?”</p>

<p>“Because, Madame, it is there I must gain the
knowledge that is to enable me to earn my bread.”</p>

<p>“A hard thing for a lady to do. Any one can see
you are a lady&mdash;your speech, your manners, your
appearance, all tell it. But, ah well, you have
youth, good looks, health! and though I’m rich, I’d
be only too glad to exchange with you,” and in her
wheezing tones, and with many a pause for breath,
the Madame went on to give a long account of her
sufferings by day and by night.</p>

<p>Floy listened with a patient attention and sincere
sympathy such as the Madame, in her loneliness, was
little accustomed to.</p>

<p>“It must be very dreadful to have so many ailments,”
she said feelingly. “I don’t know how I
could bear your difficulty of breathing even, without
any of the others.”</p>

<p>The Madame started, sat upright, and looked earnestly
at the girl, while tears gathered in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Your voice is like a half-forgotten strain of
music,” she said, sighing; “and your face&mdash;ah, it
seems as if I must have seen it in the long ago, the
happy time when I was young and life full of sunshine
and flowers. Alas, child!” she added, sinking
back upon her cushions again, “as the years roll on
how the sunlight gives place to clouds and darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>,
and the flowers fade and die! would that I could be
young again!”</p>

<p>“Were you always happy in your youthful days,
Madame?”</p>

<p>There were tears in the low, sweet voice that put
the question.</p>

<p>“No, no; indeed I believe I sometimes thought
myself quite wretched!” exclaimed the Madame;
“but I see now what a fool I was.”</p>

<p>“Supper is ready, ladies,” announced Mary,
throwing open the door of communication with the
dressing-room. “Shall I wheel you in, Madame?”</p>

<p>With a peevish reply in the negative the Madame
rose and waddled to the table, preceded by Frisky,
for whom a chair had been placed at her right hand.</p>

<p>Floy was invited to the seat opposite her hostess,
and, conscious of being a lady, accepted it with no
feeling of surprise that it was accorded her. In
fact, her thoughts were again far away, and scarcely
to be recalled by the tempting nature of the repast
or the magnificence of the solid silver and rare old
china.</p>

<p>Fortunately she was not called upon to talk or to
listen, as Frisky was taking his supper after the same
manner in which he had eaten his breakfast, Kathleen
attending to him while Mary waited upon the
table.</p>

<p>The Madame ate and drank enormously, paying
no heed to an occasional reminder from Mary that
she would have to suffer for her over-indulgence.</p>

<p>“You are a cruel creature! you would deprive me
of the only pleasure left me in life!” she at length
exclaimed passionately, as the girl almost absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
refused to help her for the sixth time to fried oysters.</p>

<p>“Madame,” replied Mary firmly, “you know the
doctor has forbidden them altogether, and that an
hour or two from now you’ll be abusing me for letting
you have any at all.”</p>

<p>At that the Madame rose, angrily pushed back her
chair and retired in a pet to her room.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte did not appear again that
evening.</p>

<p>Floy returned to her work upon the new gown immediately
upon leaving the table, and did not lay it
aside again until the clock struck ten.</p>

<p>Then Kathleen showed her to an adjoining bedroom,
whose appointments seemed to carry her back
to the happy days when she was the loved and petted
only child of well-to-do parents. Less than a year
ago she had seen the last of them, but how far, far
away they already seemed!</p>

<p>The young heart was sore with grief and care, and
not for itself alone. But the worn-out body must
have rest, and all was soon forgotten in sound, refreshing
sleep.</p>

<p>She woke in the dull gray light of the winter
morning and sprang up instantly, half trembling
with affright at thought of the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Sharp’s, breakfast was long since over.
To-morrow was Christmas, and, though not expecting
either to go out or to receive company at home,
the Madame must have her new dress to wear on that
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one found fault with Floy; the buxom
Kathleen had an excellent breakfast ready for her,
and greeting her cheerily with “The top o’ the
mornin’ to ye, miss,” waited upon her with a smiling
face.</p>

<p>She took her meal alone, as on the previous day,
and had the cosey work-room to herself for a couple
of hours; then the Madame waddled in, wheezing
and groaning, dropped into a chair, and told a pitiful
tale of her wearisome night and Mary’s crossness,
weeping and sighing as she talked.</p>

<p>Floy pitied and tried to console her, but fortunately
found it necessary to say but little, as the lady
talked on with scarcely a pause except for breath,
and presently fell to petting and caressing her lap-dog,
then to examining the dress, commenting with
much satisfaction upon its beauty and probable becomingness,
querying whether it could be finished
that day, and consulting Floy about the style of
trimming.</p>

<p>Floy advised a deep, heavy silk fringe to match
in color, or of a little darker shade.</p>

<p>The Madame caught at the idea, and Mary, coming
in at that moment, was sent to order the carriage
that she might go at once and select it herself.</p>

<p>Frisky pricked up his ears, gave a short, joyous
bark, ran to the window overlooking the side entrance,
and jumped upon a chair whence he could
see into the street.</p>

<p>“See that, miss?” queried the laughing Kathleen,
who was present, engaged in running the sewing-machine
as on the day before. “The little
baste knows more’n a babby. He always rides with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the Madame, an’ whin he hears the carriage ordered
he’s ready for a start. He’ll stay there watchin’ now
till it comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Madame, overhearing the remark,
“he’s the most intelligent little creature you
ever saw, and the prettiest. I wouldn’t part with
him for any money&mdash;the darling! Now, Mary,” as
her maid re-entered the room, “dress me at once.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Madame. What will you be pleased
to wear?”</p>

<p>“That green silk suit and the green velvet hat,”
answered her mistress, waddling into the dressing-room;
“gloves to match, and my emerald set, ear-rings,
pin, and bracelets, and a point-lace collar and
sleeves. Get out one of my worked white skirts too,
and a pair of silk stockings and gaiters.”</p>

<p>“It’s very cold, Madame; the wind from the lake
cuts like a knife, and you’ll suffer in thin shoes,”
Mary objected to the last clause of the order.</p>

<p>“Lamb’s-wool stockings, then, and kid boots.”</p>

<p>Bureau-drawers, wardrobe, and closets were laid
under contribution, and the Madame’s toilet began.</p>

<p>It had progressed to the putting on of her hat,
when, glancing in the mirror, she suddenly changed
her mind.</p>

<p>“Green doesn’t become me to-day,” she said,
“why didn’t you tell me? Take it off at once.”</p>

<p>“Tell you? much good that would have done!”
grumbled Mary, removing the obnoxious hat; “you
wouldn’t have believed me.”</p>

<p>“Get out my black velvet hat and a black silk
suit,” said her mistress, ignoring the impertinent
rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll not have time for your shopping if you
wait to dress again, Madame,” objected the girl;
“it is already half-past eleven, and the days are
short. Your black velvet cloak and hat will not
look amiss with the green dress.”</p>

<p>The Madame yielded to these suggestions all the
more readily because at that moment a joyous bark
from Frisky announced that the carriage was in waiting.</p>

<p>He sprang from the chair, rushed down to the
outside door, and scratched and whined there till
Kathleen ran down and opened it for him, when
he immediately took possession of one half of the
back seat, leaving the other for his mistress, who
presently followed, having reached the lower floor,
not by the stairs, but by the elevator, carefully lowered
by the ever-ready Kathleen.</p>

<p>Mary, without whom the Madame never stirred
from the house, took the front seat, a handsome afghan
and wolf-skin were tucked carefully about their
feet by Rory, and the carriage drove off.</p>

<p>For a short space the Madame puffed and wheezed
in silence, then she spoke:</p>

<p>“We’ll get the fringe first, and have it sent up;
then the Christmas gifts. Mary, what do you think
Miss Kemper would like?”</p>

<p>“How should I now, Madame? I’m not acquainted
with the young lady’s tastes,” returned
the maid snappishly.</p>

<p>She had a raging headache, the result of an almost
sleepless night spent in efforts to undo the evil
effects of the rich, heavy, evening meal, indulged in
by her wilful charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The Madame, who was feeling depressed and
hysterical from the same cause, put her handkerchief
to her eyes, shed a few tears, and whimpered:</p>

<p>“It’s shameful the way I’m treated by you, Mary.
There aren’t many ladies who would put up with it
as I do.”</p>

<p>“Handkerchiefs are always acceptable,” remarked
the delinquent, ignoring the reproach, but
giving the suggestion in answer to the query. Then,
by way of salve to her conscience, she added: “It’s
like your generosity to think of making a present to
a stranger.”</p>

<p>This restored the Madame to good-humor. She
was generous, and she liked to have full credit for it.</p>

<p>The day was very cold but clear and bright, and
the city was full of life and activity. Vehicles
jostled each other in the streets, pedestrians hurried
hither and thither along the sidewalks, there was a
grand display of holiday goods in the windows, and
the stores were crowded with purchasers.</p>

<p>The bustle and excitement were agreeable to
Madame Le Conte, and she found much enjoyment
in selecting her gifts and paying for them from her
well-filled purse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Floy toiled on at the dress, her
thoughts now with Espy in his anxiety and grief,
now dwelling mournfully upon the past, memory
and imagination bringing vividly before her the
loved faces that should gladden her eyes no more on
earth, and causing her to hear again each well-remembered
tone of the dear voices now silent in the
tomb.</p>

<p>She longed to seek out a solitary place and weep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
but the luxury of tears was not for her; she forced
them back, silently asking help to obey the command
to be ever “rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.”</p>

<p>Hope! ah, she had not lost that even for this life.
Espy still lived, still loved her; they might yet be
restored to each other. And her mother&mdash;that unknown
yet already dearly-loved mother&mdash;who should
say how soon she would be given to her prayers and
efforts?</p>

<p>Her needle flew more swiftly, while a tender, loving
smile played about her lips and shone in her
dark, lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>The Madame came home panting and wheezing,
but elated with her success in shopping. She was
quite ready for Christmas, and it might come as soon
as it pleased. But&mdash;ah, there was the dress!</p>

<p>“Are you going to get it done to-day?” she
asked, sinking into a chair in front of Floy, and
glancing anxiously from her to the garment and
back again.</p>

<p>“I shall try, Madame, but fear it is doubtful,”
Floy replied, raising her eyes for an instant to her
interrogator’s face.</p>

<p>The Madame started, changed color, and seemed
quite agitated for a moment. Then recovered herself.</p>

<p>“The girls shall both help you,” she said, “and
you won’t mind working in the evening, will you?
You’ll not need to go back to Mrs. Sharp’s to-night,
will you?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame; and I may as well work late here
as there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The Madame thanked her, and left the room with
a mental resolve that the girl should not lose by her
willingness to oblige.</p>

<p>“I’m worn out, Mary,” she said to her maid, who
was bestowing in a closet in the dressing-room the
numerous parcels which she and Rory had just
brought upstairs; “change my dress for a wrapper,
and I’ll lie down and take a nap while you and
Katty help with the dress. You’re not too tired, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not; it isn’t my place ever to be
too tired for anything you wish done,” grumbled
Mary, putting the last package upon the closet shelf
and closing the door with a little more force than
was necessary.</p>

<p>Then half ashamed of her petulance, in view of
the generous way in which her mistress had just been
laying out money in gifts for herself and her brother,
“I’ll do my best, Madame,” she added in a
pleasant tone, “but I hope you’ll take a light supper
to-night for your own sake as well as mine.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite as anxious to rest well at night as you
can be to have me, Mary,” returned the Madame in
an injured tone, as she sat down and began herself
to unfasten and remove her outer wrappings.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so, Madame, and you must excuse
my free speaking,” responded Mary, coming to
her assistance.</p>

<p>The Madame’s enormous weight made her a burden
to herself, and the unwonted exertion of the
day had wearied her greatly. Comfortably established
on a couch in her bedroom, she presently fell
into a sleep so profound that she was not disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
when her maid stole softly in at nightfall, drew the
curtains, lighted the gas, and retired again.</p>

<p>But a moment later the Madame awoke with a low
cry, and starting to a sitting posture, rubbed her
eyes and glanced hurriedly about the room.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she sighed, sinking back again, “it was
a dream, only a dream! I shall never see her more!
My darling, oh, my darling! How could I be so
cruel, so cruel! Pansy, Pansy! And I am so
lonely, so lonely! with not a soul in the wide world
to care for me!”</p>

<p>Sobs and tears came thick and fast; then she
rose, slowly crossed the room, turned up the gas,
and unlocking her jewel-box, took from it a small,
plain gold locket attached to a slender chain.</p>

<p>It opened with a touch, showing a sweet, sunny
child face, with smiling lips, soft, wavy brown hair,
and large, dark, lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>The Madame wept anew as she gazed upon it, and
her broad breast heaved with sigh after sigh.</p>

<p>“So many years! so many years!” she moaned,
“and my search has been all in vain. Ah, dear one,
are you yet in the land of the living? My darling,
my darling!” and the tears fell in floods.</p>

<p>But at length growing calmer, she restored the
trinket to its place, turned down the gas, and staggering
to an easy chair beside the window, dropped
heavily into it.</p>

<p>Her breath came pantingly, the tears still stood in
her eyes. She wiped them away, and drawing aside
the curtain, looked into the street.</p>

<p>The moon had not yet risen, but the lamps were
lighted, and there was a clear, starlit sky. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
see the passers-by as they hurried on their way, now
singly, now in groups of two or more; mostly well,
or at least comfortably, clad, and carrying brown-paper
parcels suggestive of the coming festivities.</p>

<p>A confectionery on the opposite corner was ablaze
with light, showing a tempting array of sweets in the
windows. It was crowded with customers, and there
was a constant passing in and out of cheerful-looking
men and women and bright-eyed, eager children.</p>

<p>Presently a slender figure, apparently that of a
very young girl, very shabbily dressed in faded calico
and with an old shawl thrown over her head
caught the Madame’s attention.</p>

<p>She came suddenly around the corner, and though
shivering with cold, her thin garments flapping in
the wind, stood gazing with longing eyes upon the
piles of fruit, cakes, and candies. The Madame’s eyes
filled as she noted the child’s hungry look and scant
clothing. With a great effort she rose and threw a
shawl about her shoulders; then she went to a
drawer in her bureau where she kept loose change,
and returning, tapped on the sash, threw it up, and
called to the girl, who had not moved from her station
on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>She turned, however, at the sound of the voice,
and seeing a beckoning hand, crossed swiftly over.</p>

<p>“Stand under here and hold out your shawl,”
wheezed the Madame. “There! now run back and
buy yourself a lot of goodies for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am, oh, thank you!” cried the
child as the window went down again, and the
Madame dropped into her chair, wheezing and
coughing, to find her maid close at her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Madame, are you mad?” exclaimed Mary.
“Your bare head out of the window this bitter cold
night. Well, if either of us gets a wink of sleep it’ll
be more than I expect!”</p>

<p>The Madame’s cough forbade a reply for the moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you your drops,” said Mary, running to
a closet where medicines were kept. “I can’t
imagine what on earth induced you to do such a
foolish thing. Why didn’t you ring for me?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” panted the Madame; “you seem
to forget that I’m my own mistress, and yours too.
Is the dress nearly done?”</p>

<p>“We can finish it by sitting up, if you’ll let Katty
wait on you. All the machine stitching’s done, and
only Miss Kemper and I can work on it now; so
Katty’s gone down to get you some supper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“But you know, Madame, you’ll be ill if you
don’t eat; fasting never agrees with you, no more
than over-eating.”</p>

<p>Kathleen came in at that moment bearing a tempting
little repast upon a silver waiter, which she set
down before her mistress.</p>

<p>The Madame at first refused to eat, but presently,
yielding to the combined entreaties and expostulations
of the two, made a very tolerable attempt.
Kathleen was retained to wait upon her, and Mary
was directed to assist Floy until the gown should be
completed.</p>

<p>“You’re looking very tired,” the latter remarked,
as Mary resumed her seat by her side.</p>

<p>“Not a bit more’n you do, miss,” said the girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
with a compassionate glance at Floy’s pale cheeks
and heavy eyes. “Dear me! don’t you think riches
harden the heart? There’s the Madame has a dozen
elegant silk dresses, good as new, if she has one, yet
we must both wear ourselves out to get this done
for to-morrow, though there won’t be a soul besides
ourselves here to look at it, unless the lawyer or
doctor should happen to call, which ain’t in the least
likely, seein’ it’s a holiday.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, we may consider ourselves blest
in being poor,” Floy returned cheerfully; “and
which of us would exchange our health for the poor
Madame’s wealth?”</p>

<p>“Not I, I’m sure,” said Mary, shaking her head;
“she’s worth her thousands, and has everything that
money can buy, but she has never an hour’s ease or
happiness.”</p>

<p>Both were too weary, Floy too heartsore, to be in
a talkative mood; so they worked on in silence till
startled from it by a sudden loud peal from the
door-bell.</p>

<p>“Who can that be?” exclaimed Mary, laying
down her work and glancing at the clock on the
mantel; “half-past nine, and we never have any
callers of evenings. There,” returning to her work
at the sound of the opening and shutting of a door,
followed by footsteps hastily descending the stairs,
“Katty’s gone to answer it.”</p>

<p>The next minute Floy felt a light tap on her
shoulder, and looked up to find Hetty’s bright, cheery
face bending over her.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ve surprised you! Thought I should.
Hope the shock will be good for your nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>”
Hetty said, laughing in a pleased, kindly way at
Floy’s start and joyous exclamation:</p>

<p>“Oh! is it you? how glad I am!”</p>

<p>“Yes; John and I have come to take you home.”</p>

<p>“John?”</p>

<p>“One of Aunt Prue’s boys. The children have
come home for the holidays&mdash;but wouldn’t Araminta
take my head off if she heard me say that! She’s
the youngest, has arrived at the mature age of
fifteen, and considers herself wiser than her parents
or ‘than ten men that can render a reason.’ Come,
put on your things, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could, but I have engaged to finish this
to-night, and there’s a full hour’s work on it yet.”</p>

<p>“Not if I help,” said Hetty, pulling off her gloves
and taking a thimble from her pocket. “I’ll call
master John up and give him a book. You see I
came prepared for emergencies.”</p>

<p>“He won’t like it, will he?”</p>

<p>“He’s a dear good fellow, and would do more
than that for me; or for you when he knows you.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The hands on the dial-plate of the clock pointed
to quarter-past ten as Hetty’s nimble fingers set the
last stitch in the gown and Floy drew on her gloves,
having already donned hat and cloak in obedience
to orders.</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Hetty, putting her needle in the
cushion and her thimble into her pocket. “Now,
John, make way with these few basting threads
while I put on my duds, there’s a good soul!”</p>

<p>John&mdash;a well-grown lad of seventeen, in looks a
happy mixture of father and mother, in character an
improvement upon both, having his mother’s energy
without her hardness and closeness&mdash;laid down the
paper he had been reading, and with the smiling
rejoinder, “Pretty work to set a man at, Het!” was
about to comply with her request when Mary, coming
in from her mistress’s bedroom, her hands full
of packages, interposed:</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind them! I’ll have them all
out in the morning before the Madame’s up. Here,
Miss Goodenough, Miss Kemper, and Mr. John,
she charged me to give you each one of these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
They’re boxes of fine candies. She always lays in
a great store of them about Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” cried John as the street-door closed
on him and his companions, “won’t I have the
laugh on Lu to-night, Het? He’d never have let me
be your gallant if he’d thought there was a box of
candy to be won by it.”</p>

<p>“A good thing he didn’t; he’ll manage as it is
to get enough to make himself sick,” she returned
somewhat scornfully.</p>

<p>“It was so kind in you to come for me,” remarked
Floy. “How did you happen to do it, Hetty?”</p>

<p>“Because we wanted you&mdash;mother and I at least&mdash;and
we thought it was getting too late for you to
come alone.”</p>

<p>Floy was very weary in body, inexpressibly sad
and weary in heart and mind. She strove to shake
off her depression and respond to Hetty’s merry
mood; but in vain. She could not banish the thick-coming
memories of other holiday seasons made
bright and joyous by the gifts, and still more by the
love, of those of whom she was now bereaved by
death and enforced separation.</p>

<p>Ah, what of Espy to-night?</p>

<p>Hetty read something of this in the sad eyes, and
her mood changed to quiet, subdued cheerfulness.</p>

<p>They entered the house quietly, letting themselves
in with a latch-key, and passed into the room
back of the store.</p>

<p>Floy uttered a slight exclamation of pleased surprise
as John turned up the light.</p>

<p>The room had put on quite a festive appearance;
all signs of work had vanished, and it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
made neat and orderly, and its walls tastefully decorated
with evergreens.</p>

<p>“John’s doings,” said Hetty, pushing a cushioned
arm-chair nearer the fire. “Sit down here, my dear,
and we’ll have some refreshments shortly; you see
the kettle’s boiling, and the coals are just splendid,
and we can take our time, as we’re not obliged to
rise early to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Toast and tea, Jack, my boy; you and I know how
to make ’em,” she went on, throwing off cloak and
hat, and producing the requisite articles from a
closet beside the chimney.</p>

<p>“I’ve already had three good meals to-day,” observed
Floy, smiling slightly.</p>

<p>“What of that? four or five hours of hard work
since the last, beside a brisk walk and a ride through
the cold, ought to have made you ready for
another,” returned Hetty, giving John the toaster
and a slice of bread, then putting on the tea to
draw.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing for me to do?” asked Floy.</p>

<p>“Yes; warm yourself thoroughly. Ah, what a
good forgettery I have of my own! Here’s something
else to employ you. A bit of Christmas in it, I suspect,”
she ran on, taking a letter from the mantel
and putting it into Floy’s hand.</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure came into the young girl’s
cheek as she recognized in the address the writing
of her old friend Miss Wells, but faded again instantly,
leaving it paler than before.</p>

<p>What news did this missive bring? would it tell
her of Espy, and that sorrow and bereavement had
befallen him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>She broke the seal with a trembling hand. Ah, if
she were only alone!</p>

<p>But Hetty and John, busy with their culinary labors,
might have been unconscious of her existence
for all the notice they seemed to be taking of her
movements.</p>

<p>She opened the letter. A pair of black kid gloves
and a folded bank-note fell into her lap; but without
waiting to examine them, she glanced her eye
down the page.</p>

<p>It was a kind, motherly letter, saying a great deal
in few words; for Miss Wells had but little time to
give to correspondence.</p>

<p>“She sent a trifling gift just to assure her dear
child of her loving remembrance, and she inclosed ten
dollars, fearing her purse might be low (she had not
forgotten how it was with herself in the days when
she was an apprentice and getting nothing but her
board for her work); and if Floy did not like to
take it as a gift, as she would be only too glad to
have her do, then let it stand as a loan.”</p>

<p>“How kind, how very kind!” thought Floy.</p>

<p>Yes, her purse was very low, and such a loan
from such a source was very acceptable. Ah, here
was Espy’s name! He had been called home to see
his mother die; she had had a stroke of paralysis,
but the case was not hopeless; she might linger a
good while, and perhaps get about again.</p>

<p>Floy breathed more freely.</p>

<p>There were just a few more lines.</p>

<p>“Dear child, sorrow and care will sometimes
press heavily; you will sadly miss the old loves;
but take heart: ‘He careth for you,’ He who loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
you with a greater, tenderer love than a mother’s,
and hath all power in heaven and in earth.”</p>

<p>“Good news, I see! and I’m real glad for you,
poor child!” said Hetty softly, as she handed Floy
a cup of fragrant tea and a slice of hot buttered
toast, and in so doing caught the look of sweet peace
and joy in the dewy eyes lifted from the letter to her
face.</p>

<p>“Good news? oh, yes indeed! that I’m not forgotten,
that I’m loved and cared for still by&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, don’t I know how nice it is to be
remembered by home friends when you’re far
away!” Hetty put in quickly, as the low, tremulous
tones faltered and fell, and Floy hastily drew out
her handkerchief to wipe away the tears she could
not keep back.</p>

<p>“I too,” said John, buttering his toast and taking
a sip of tea; “a fellow gets awfully homesick
sometimes at school, and a letter such as you, for instance,
dash off once in a while, Het, does him a
world of good.”</p>

<p>“News from home,” whispered Floy to herself,
as she laid her weary head upon her pillow; “yes,
from my Father’s house; a sweet message from
my Elder Brother on the throne, reminding me anew
that He cares for me; how strange that, knowing
that, I can ever be sad and anxious!”</p>

<p>It was the last waking thought. But, alas! what a
pang of remembrance came with the first moment of
returning consciousness! One year ago how loved
and cared for, to-day how lonely and forsaken!</p>

<p>Ah no, not that! “He careth for you,” sweetly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
whispered the Comforter to her aching heart, and
she was comforted.</p>

<p>A few quiet tears dropped upon her pillow, but
they were not all of sadness.</p>

<p>A faint rustling sound came from the bed on the
other side of the room, then a whisper from Hetty.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, mothery! how are you this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m splendid! I’m going to say everything’s
splendid now. Merry Christmas to you too.
I wish I had a million to give you.”</p>

<p>“A million of what, mothery?” laughed the girl.</p>

<p>“Dollars, to be sure! But what is it Shakespeare
says?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, mothery; but it’s getting light,
and I must get up and see about breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re to have Indian; Thorne insisted
on it.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is that?” thought Floy,
raising her head to look at Hetty, who was making
a hasty but very quiet toilet.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!” they
cried simultaneously, ending in a merry laugh.</p>

<p>“We’ll exchange Yankee sixpences when we get
our faces washed,” said Hetty. “Breakfast in
twenty minutes precisely. Indian all hot and hot!”
and with the last word she darted from the room.</p>

<p>“Thorne gives a good bit o’ trouble one way and
another,” observed Mrs. Goodenough, who had
risen also and was dressing much more deliberately
than Hetty had done; “he’ll have what he wants
in spite of everything (in the line of trouble to other
folks ’specially). But then there ain’t many that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>’s
equivalent to him in learning. There isn’t anything
but what he’s read; he knows everything.
So it’s quite natural Prue should be proud of him
and spoil him with humoring all his whims.”</p>

<p>“Do we all breakfast together this morning, Mrs.
Goodenough?” asked Floy.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I’m going to wear this thick wrapper;
it’s not handsome or dressy, but the comfort supersedes
the outward appearance.”</p>

<p>With this remark she left the room.</p>

<p>Floy was glad of the few moments of solitude
thus afforded her. It was growing light, and she
found time before the call to breakfast for another
peep at her precious letter. She hurried down at
the first stroke of the bell, anxious to avoid meeting
the Sharps on the stairway.</p>

<p>Patsy, in her ordinary soiled, frowsy-headed, slipshod
condition, was setting the chairs up to the table,
on which Mrs. Goodenough and Hetty were arranging
an unusually inviting meal.</p>

<p>“Don’t delude yourself with the hope that you are
about to be regaled upon pound-cake, Miss Kemper,”
remarked Hetty, placing a loaf of hot corn-pone
near Floy’s plate, another at the farther end of
the board.</p>

<p>“No, it’s only Indian,” said Mrs. Goodenough,
“but it’s splendid, and more than equivalent to
pound-cake for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” said Floy, “<em>I</em> greatly prefer it, at
any rate; I’m extremely fond of good corn-bread.”</p>

<p>“Well, Hetty’s is always superior to the best.”</p>

<p>“Superior to the best, eh?” sneered the Thorne,
as with pompous air he came leisurely in and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
his accustomed seat. “Madam, that is a contradiction
in terms.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t good enough for you, you needn’t
eat it,” she returned indifferently; “but let’s sit
down and begin while it’s hot.”</p>

<p>The Thorne was evidently in no holiday mood.
“Where are the children?” he demanded, with a
scowl, glancing about upon the empty seats as he
took up the carving knife and fork.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for them; they’ll be here presently,”
said his wife.</p>

<p>“Presently, madam!” he growled; “they ought to
have been ready an hour ago. You are bringing up
your children to ruinous habits of self-indulgence.”</p>

<p>“Example is better than precept,” Hetty could
not help remarking.</p>

<p>“And pray, miss, what do you mean by that?” he
asked, turning almost fiercely upon her.</p>

<p>“Surely a man of Mr. Sharp’s talent and erudition
can have no difficulty in understanding words so
simple,” she replied, with a twinkle of fun in her
eye.</p>

<p>“Come, don’t let’s quarrel to-day of all days in
the year,” put in her mother good-humoredly.
“Here’s John, anyhow,” as the lad came briskly in
with a “Merry Christmas to you all!”</p>

<p>“Where have you been, sir, that you are so late to
this very late breakfast?” asked his father, ignoring
the greeting.</p>

<p>“Round to the grocer’s on the corner, sir.”</p>

<p>“Doing an errand for me,” said Hetty, “and he’s
not to be scolded; for if it hadn’t been for him&mdash;getting
me kindling to hurry up my fire, and assisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in various ways&mdash;breakfast would have been later
than it is.”</p>

<p>“Where now, Prudence?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp had risen hastily and pushed back her
chair.</p>

<p>“I must go up and see if Araminta is sick, Thorne;
the poor thing was too tired yesterday with her journey
to do anything but lounge about.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I dare say; you are ruining that child
with your coddling.”</p>

<p>“Ah, here she comes! Lucian too,” said Mrs.
Sharp in a relieved tone, resuming her seat as the
door opened and a girl of fifteen, looking only half
awake and far from neat, in a loose, somewhat soiled
morning dress and hair in crimps, came languidly in,
followed by a lad some four years older, the veritable
counterpart of his father in appearance and manners.</p>

<p>The latter had a scowl and rebuke for each, which
were received as matters of course.</p>

<p>“Don’t scold ’em, Thorne,” said their aunt; “the
poor things have so much book attention when
they’re at school!”</p>

<p>“You’re rather late, children,” the mother remarked,
helping them bountifully; “times are
changed since you were little things. Then we
could hardly keep you from waking us too soon
Christmas morning.”</p>

<p>“That was when we were children indeed, and
hung up our stockings,” said Lucian, “and didn’t
know what was in them. Now you just give us the
money and let us buy for ourselves.”</p>

<p>A loud peal from the door-bell sent Patsy flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
out to the hall. She returned in a moment with a
letter, two packages, and the morning paper.</p>

<p>“For me! I know they are!” cried Araminta,
waking up. “Here, Patsy, give them to me. Dear
me, no! how provoking! they’re every one directed
to Miss Kemper,” and she looked around inquiringly.</p>

<p>Upon that John introduced the two, and Floy’s
property was somewhat reluctantly resigned to her.</p>

<p>She had finished her meal, and, asking to be excused,
was leaving the room, when an exclamation
from John, who was glancing over the paper, stayed
her steps.</p>

<p>“Lea! what Lea is it, I wonder?&mdash;‘was arrested
yesterday on a criminal charge, and has committed
suicide. His affairs are found to be hopelessly involved.’”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it give his Christian name?” asked
Mrs. Sharp, with interest.</p>

<p>“Yes: Abner.”</p>

<p>“Just so; there’s a good customer lost!” she exclaimed
in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p>“And they were so rich!” remarked her sister;
“what turns of the wheel of fortune! What is it
Shakespeare says?”</p>

<p>Floy hurried away to the privacy of Hetty’s parlor,
sighing softly to herself, “Poor Miss Carrie!
Ah, there are heavier trials than mine!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Hetty looked in. “May I see
what Santa Claus has sent you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. A dozen beautifully fine handkerchiefs,
with Madame Le Conte’s card&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just like her! she’s the soul of generosity so far
as money is concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>“And a letter&mdash;such a nice one&mdash;and some warm
stockings of her own knitting from my kind old
friend Mrs. Bond,” concluded Floy.</p>

<p>“How splendid!” said Hetty. “You shall sit
here and answer it, and the other if you like, while I
see about dinner; and this afternoon we’ll take a
walk and look at the fine things in the shop windows.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Madame Le Conte was suffering from her imprudent
exposure on Christmas-eve. She had taken
cold, and her increased difficulty of breathing had
robbed both herself and Mary of the greater part of
their night’s rest.</p>

<p>The gift of a black silk dress and a few trinkets
mollified the maid’s ill-humor, but Madame was
sadly depressed in spirit.</p>

<p>“Go downstairs and enjoy yourself, Mary,” she
said when she had sent away her almost untasted
breakfast. “I’m poor company for any one, and
prefer to be alone.”</p>

<p>“Let me read to you,” said Mary, taking a new
book from the table. “This book is lively and interesting.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Then here’s the morning paper.”</p>

<p>“Take it and read it yourself. I tell you I wish
to be alone. Go! I’ll ring when I want you.”
And Madame waved her hand imperiously.</p>

<p>She was in her dressing-room, a cheery apartment
elegantly furnished with every appliance for comfort
and convenience; a velvet carpet of exquisite design
covered the floor, lace and damask draped the windows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
one or two fine paintings adorned the delicately-tinted
walls; articles of virtu were scattered
here and there; everything the eye rested on was
beautiful and appropriate.</p>

<p>Her easy chair was drawn up before the fire (she
loved open fires, and had them in every room much
frequented by herself), and on a costly Persian rug
at her feet Frisky lay sleeping, her only companion
since Mary had gone out in obedience to her order,
softly closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Perhaps there were few sadder hearts to-day in all
the great city than that of this rich but childless and
lonely woman. She sat with her hands folded in her
lap, sigh after sigh heaving her bosom, and tears
trickling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Remorse, remorse!” she whispered almost under
her breath; “can there be anything worse? Oh,
Pansy, my little Pansy! where are you? living or
dead? Are you poor and suffering? Oh, come
back, come back to me, and gladly, gladly will I
share with you all I have!”</p>

<p>Covering her face with her handkerchief, she
sobbed aloud, her whole frame shaking with the violence
of her emotion.</p>

<p>This lasted several minutes; then, gradually growing
calmer, she wiped away her tears, rose, went to
her jewel-box, and possessing herself of the little
locket she had been looking on the previous night,
returned to her chair by the fire, touched the spring,
and again gazed mournfully upon the pretty child-face.</p>

<p>She sat there for hours with the locket in her hand,
sometimes looking at the picture, dropping tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
upon the sweet face, pressing it to her lips; at others
lying back among her cushions with closed eyes, while
quick-coming memories of the past thronged through
her brain.</p>

<p>At length Mary became alarmed, and ventured in
without being summoned.</p>

<p>Her mistress was again gazing at the miniature,
and seemed unconscious of her entrance until she
stood close at her side.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons for intruding upon you,
Madame,” said the girl, “but I grew frightened lest
you had been taken suddenly ill and were not able
to ring.”</p>

<p>“See! look! tell me if you see any resemblance
to any one,” said the Madame huskily, holding out the
picture, the tears stealing down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“No-o, Madame,” returned the maid doubtfully,
gazing upon it with some surprise that she had never
been shown it before&mdash;she who had deemed herself
fully acquainted with the contents of her mistress’s
jewel-box.</p>

<p>“No?” cried the Madame irritably. “Look again.
Well? Speak out; do not fear to offend.”</p>

<p>“That young girl we had here yesterday&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well? well? go on; what of her?” asked the
Madame, fairly struggling for breath in her excitement.</p>

<p>“I can imagine she might have looked like this
years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! I have thought so too;” and tears
rained down the Madame’s cheeks.</p>

<p>Mary’s curiosity was strongly excited, but she indulged
in no questions or remarks in regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
original of the picture; she had learned long since
that her mistress would tolerate no prying into the
secrets of her past life. She waited a moment in
silence, then said soothingly, “Come, Madame,
cheer up. Just consider how much you have to
make you happy. Look at this beautiful room, this
grand house&mdash;all your own; your elegant dresses
too; your silks and laces and jewels; your fine carriage
and horses; Katty and Rory and me to wait
on you, and your loads of money. Why, Madame,
who would not be glad to change places with you?”</p>

<p>“You, Mary?” she asked, with sudden impulse,
extending her maimed limb toward the girl, her
breast heaving with sobs, her eyes full of passionate
sorrow; “say, would you give your good right hand
for all my wealth? to say nothing of my struggles
for breath, and all the rest of it?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know you would <em>not</em>! Then don’t talk to me
of how fortunate I am,” she said, heaving a deep
sigh as she drew back the hand, laid her head against
the cushions, and averted her face.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, Madame, none of us can have everything,”
observed the girl, “and we must all make
the best of our lot. There’s some that’s sick and
crippled, and poor too; not a bite or sup, or fire to
keep ’em warm this cold day. And we’ve everything
that’s good downstairs, thanks to your generosity
and your full purse. Now what will you have
for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Dinner!” Madame turned her head away with a
look and gesture of disgust as if loathing the very
thought of food, and by an imperative wave of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
hand indicated that it was her pleasure that her maid
should consider herself dismissed from her presence.</p>

<p>Without another word Mary promptly left the
room, but within half an hour returned, accompanied
by Kathleen, the two bringing with them materials
for a most tempting meal, which they quickly spread
out upon the table, and presently found means to induce
their mistress to eat of, with very considerable
appetite.</p>

<p>The Madame’s mental anguish had been real, but
the violence of the paroxysm was over for the time,
and the long-indulged love of the pleasures of the table
asserted its sway.</p>

<p>But the poor lady’s enjoyments were few; she was
an educated but not an intellectual woman, and cared
little for any books except novels of the most frivolous
and sensational class; she had no friends, hardly an
acquaintance in the city, having purposely avoided
society from extreme sensitiveness regarding the loss
of her hand&mdash;a loss which had befallen her prior to
the removal of herself and husband to Chicago. And
she was also a stranger to the consolations of religion.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve taken you too far: you look
dreadfully tired!” said Hetty, as she and Floy
reached home after their walk.</p>

<p>“No, don’t worry, I’ve enjoyed it very much; a
walk on an agreeable errand, and in pleasant company,
is such a rare treat nowadays. It’s only a
headache,” Floy answered, trying to smile.</p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> a headache! I call that worse than only being
tired. I’m real sorry for you. Just go into my
parlor and take off your things and lie down on the
lounge. You’ll be nice and quiet there, and you’re
not to mind the supper-bell. I’ll bring you a cup of
tea and some toast.”</p>

<p>Rest and quiet. They were what the weary frame,
the aching head, and homesick heart craved just then
above everything else that seemed attainable.</p>

<p>Ah, were even they within her reach? Sounds of
wrangling and strife assailed her ears as she neared
the door of the little back room where Hetty had entertained
her the previous night. Opening it, this
was the scene which presented itself:</p>

<p>The gas was blazing high, and just beneath it Araminta
lolled back in an arm-chair, her feet propped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
up on the seat of another, and a paper-covered novel
in her hand, which Lucian, standing over her puffing
away at a cigar, seemed to be trying to wrest
from her.</p>

<p>“See here, Miss Mintstick,” he was saying, “I
got this out of the library for my own enjoyment, so
just give it up.”</p>

<p>“You hateful fellow!” she cried, “you know I
can’t bear to be called that, and I’ll just tell mother
of you if you don’t stop it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a baby, is it? and mustn’t be teased,” he
said jeeringly; whereat Araminta burst into tears,
and again threatened to “tell mother of him.”</p>

<p>“Come, it’s quite too young to read novels,” he
said, with another and successful effort to take it
from her.</p>

<p>“So are you too, Miss Lucy Ann! There! take
that!” she retorted, giving him a resounding slap
upon the cheek.</p>

<p>Flushing crimson, he seized her by the wrist.</p>

<p>“See here, young woman!” he hissed in a tone of
concentrated fury.</p>

<p>But becoming suddenly aware of Floy’s presence,
and that she was standing gazing upon them in disgust
and astonishment, he turned shamefacedly
away, muttering, “A man can’t stand everything!”
and would have beaten a hasty retreat, but encountered
his mother in the doorway.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of all this?” she asked
sharply. “What are you two quarrelling about?
I’m ashamed of you! And the room full of tobacco-smoke,
the gas turned on full head! you’ll ruin
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned it lower as she spoke; then catching
sight of Floy, now seated on the lounge taking off
her gloves,</p>

<p>“Don’t mind ’em, Miss Kemper,” she said;
“they’re fond of each other for all.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit fond of Lucian!” whimpered Araminta,
“he’s so rude and bearish; so different from
the nice young men one reads about in books. He
snatched that book away from me, and nearly broke
my finger off.”</p>

<p>“You look pale, Miss Kemper. I hope you’re not
going to be sick,” remarked Mrs. Sharp as Floy rose
to leave the room. “We’ll have to be up and at work
betimes to-morrow. There are a number of dresses
to be finished, and only ourselves to do it, for the
other girls won’t be back till Monday.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a headache and the tobacco-smoke, I
think,” Floy answered in a patient tone. “I’ll go
up and lie down on my bed, and perhaps it will pass
off.”</p>

<p>And so the weary round of ceaseless toil was to
begin to-morrow! Ah, well! she would struggle on
in hope; perhaps better days would come. And
to-morrow would be Saturday, the next the blessed
day of rest, God’s own gift to the toil-worn and
weary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp, Hetty, and Floy had need of it after
the labors of the intervening day; the last-named
more especially, as having feebler powers of endurance
than the other two.</p>

<p>Lucian and Araminta were pressed into the service,
but, with their whimpering, dawdling ways,
proved of small assistance. John was a far more efficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
aid; ran the sewing-machine for hours, doing
the work well, and lightening their labors with his
cheery good-nature and innocent jests.</p>

<p>As the clock told the hour of midnight Floy stuck
the needle in her work and began to fold it up.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes more would finish that, Miss Kemper,
so that it could be sent home in the morning,”
said Mrs. Sharp persuasively.</p>

<p>“I am very, very weary, Mrs. Sharp,” returned
the young girl respectfully; “yet to accommodate
you and the customer I would work on a little
longer, but it is already the Lord’s day, and the command
is, ‘In it thou shalt not do any work.’”</p>

<p>A portentous frown was darkening the face of her
employer, but it changed to an expression of enforced
resignation as Hetty said:</p>

<p>“You’re right, Floy. Aunt Prue, I can’t go on
any longer; and indeed what right has anybody to
ask us to work as late as this?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp sat in moody silence for a moment, but,
being greatly fatigued herself, presently acquiesced
and followed their example, remarking:</p>

<p>“Well, well, girls, I don’t blame you. There
really is no use in killing ourselves, for nobody’ll
thank us for it.”</p>

<p>“Whatever should I do without you, Hetty!” said
Floy as they two went up the stairs together.</p>

<p>Monday morning brought a note that greatly
vexed Mrs. Sharp, but to our heroine seemed a
Heaven-sent relief.</p>

<p>To the usual discomforts of the work-room were
now added almost incessant squabbling between
Lucian and Araminta, the whining complaints of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
latter and the sickening scent of the cheap cigars frequently
indulged in by the former.</p>

<p>She had been asking herself how all this was to be
endured until next Monday should take them back
to their studies; and now came the answer&mdash;this
request of Madame Le Conte for her services during
the whole week.</p>

<p>The lady desired some alteration in the trimming
of the new dress, and had other work which only
Miss Kemper could do to suit her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp fumed and fretted, grumbled and
scolded, yet nevertheless the request was promptly
granted.</p>

<p>“Sure an’ I’m plazed to see ye, miss!” was Kathleen’s
smiling greeting as she admitted Floy. “The
Madame’s been wearyin’ for ye, and couldn’t be aisy
at all, at all, till she’d got the note sint to tell ye to
come. Will ye have a bite o’ breakfast?”</p>

<p>Floy declined, and was then requested to walk
right up to the sewing-room.</p>

<p>She found Mary there, and receiving directions as
to the wishes of the Madame, who had not yet risen,
settled herself to her work with an odd feeling of being
at home.</p>

<p>“The Madame has taken a wonderful fancy to
you, miss,” remarked Mary, gazing earnestly at the
young girl, and thinking her more than ever like the
miniature in her mistress’s locket.</p>

<p>“Has she?” Floy asked in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I hope you’ll try to cheer her up, miss;
she’s been dreadfully downhearted of late, crying
’most all day Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>“No wonder; she seems to suffer so much, and
to be so alone in the world, poor thing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it; she often cries by the hour; and
when I ask what’s the matter, she says, ‘I haven’t a
soul in the world to care for me, Mary; my family
are all dead and gone.’ Poor creature! it’s sad
enough, and I ought to be patient with her; but indeed,
miss, it’s often enough to try the patience of a
saint&mdash;the way she goes on, wantin’ to be dressed a
half a dozen times a day, and wakin’ me up to wait
on her every hour in the night. There’s her bell
now, and I must be gone.”</p>

<p>“Poor woman!” sighed Floy to herself. “I wonder
if she knows of the Friend whose love is everything
to me now? I wish I could tell her what comfort
and rest it gives.”</p>

<p>The Madame was still in bed. Frisky had crept in
beside her, and Mary found her petting and caressing
him.</p>

<p>“My pretty pet! my little darling!” she was saying,
“you at least love me. And I love you, precious
little beauty. Ah, Mary,” to her maid as she
caught sight of her, “so there you are! Just bring
the darling’s silver bells, and a pink ribbon to tie
them with. He wants them, I know he does, the
pretty pet!”</p>

<p>Mary obeyed, fastening the string of tiny, tinkling
bells about the dog’s neck, and could not refrain
from joining her mistress’s laugh over his evident
delight in his finery.</p>

<p>“Has he had his breakfast, Mary?” the Madame
inquired with solicitude, “and did he eat with appetite?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
You know I thought him dull and droopy yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame, I know; but I’m sure, as I told
you then, it was nothing but want of exercise and
over-eating.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Mary! you forget that he takes an airing
with me almost every day.”</p>

<p>“No, Madame, but I should say he needed more
than that. Yes, he had his breakfast, and eat a
plenty.”</p>

<p>“That is well. Has Miss Kemper come?”</p>

<p>Mary answered the query, and made a report of the
work and directions she had given Floy, at the same
time busying herself in assisting the Madame with
her toilet.</p>

<p>That week was a busy one to Floy, yet restful also,
albeit she was somewhat sated with the Madame’s
company, often wearying enough to those who must
listen to her complainings and submit to her whims.</p>

<p>Yet she was at times quite entertaining. Frisky’s
little tricks, too, were really very amusing. Besides,
Floy had every day several quiet, usually solitary
hours&mdash;while the Madame slept&mdash;was fed upon the
fat of the land, and retired to bed reasonably early
each night.</p>

<p>On returning to Mrs. Sharp’s, she was not grieved
to learn that the young people had already left for
school.</p>

<p>Work slackened slightly for a few weeks, then
again, as the spring season opened, they were almost
overwhelmed with it.</p>

<p>And this was the state of affairs until the fervid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
heats of summer began to drive the fashionables
away from the city.</p>

<p>Even then there was small respite, for some
left unfinished dresses to be sent after them,
and many who remained behind wanted work done
also.</p>

<p>In all this time Floy had heard but once from
Cranley&mdash;a few lines from Miss Wells telling of the
death of Espy’s mother, and that he had gone she
knew not whither.</p>

<p>“Gone!” Floy’s heart almost stood still with
grief and pain; but the next instant gave a quick,
joyous bound at the thought, “It may be he has
but come here in search of me.”</p>

<p>And for days and weeks every peal from the door-bell
made her heart beat fast and sent a quiver
through her nerves.</p>

<p>But he came not; and remembering that he could
have no clue to her residence unless through the
Leas, who had disappeared from society and probably
from his knowledge, she called herself a fool for
having indulged any such expectation.</p>

<p>The poor girl had grown very weary in body and
mind, and oh, so homesick! Ah, could she but go
back for a little while to the old haunts and look
again upon the dear graves of her loved ones! But
for that she had neither time nor means.</p>

<p>One day in July there came a summons for Floy
from Madame Le Conte; bereavement had come
upon the wealthy widow, so the note stated, and
Floy’s services were wanted in the making up of
mourning.</p>

<p>“Bereaved!” the girl said to herself in surprise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
“she told me she had not a relative or friend in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I was giving the Madame credit for
being considerate for once in her life in choosing a
slack time to send for you, Miss Kemper,” said Mrs.
Sharp, refolding the note and tossing it from her
after reading it aloud, “but it being a death, of
course she didn’t choose.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a change for you, and I hope will do you
good,” said Hetty, who had for some time past
noticed with concern Floy’s increasing languor.
“You’ve found the heat of the city hard to bear, not
being used to it as we are; and this&mdash;so far out, and
close to the lake shore too&mdash;will be like a taste of the
country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Mrs. Goodenough in her slow
way, “it’s quite a providence. What is it Shakespeare
says? or is it in the Bible now?” she queried
meditatively.</p>

<p>“What, Aunt Sarah?” asked Araminta pertly,
while Lucian “Haw hawed!” and exclaimed in loud,
rough tones:</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, Aunt Sarah! it’s a sin and a
shame that you haven’t a full set of Shakespeare’s
works, seeing there’s nobody tries to quote him
oftener.”</p>

<p>The young people were at home again for the summer
holidays; the time was directly after dinner,
and all the family, excepting John and his father,
were in the sitting-room at the moment.</p>

<p>Hetty treated the rude boy to a severe look, and
seemed more than half inclined to box his ears.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite true that my memory isn’t what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
it used to be,” sighed her mother, “but it’s something
about the wind and the shorn lamb, and I
rather think it’s in the Bible.”</p>

<p>“It’s Sterne, mother,” said Hetty. “‘God tempers
the wind to the shorn lamb.’”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t suit,” laughed Araminta, “for
Miss Kemper has an awful lot of hair, and if she was
shorn it’s so dreadful hot to-day that anybody’d be
glad to get where the wind would blow on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, children!” said Mrs. Sharp. “Miss
Kemper, I s’pose you’d better go at once.”</p>

</div>

<p>“The Madame bereaved! of whom, I wonder?”
mused Floy, riding along in the almost empty street-car.
“Has she discovered the existence of a relative
only to see him or her snatched away by death? Ah,
poor woman! so unhappy before, what will she be
now?”</p>

<p>Leaving the car, the young girl quickly passed over
the short intervening distance, and glancing up at the
Madame’s house as she approached it, saw that the
shutters of every window were bowed with white ribbon,
while several yards of white cashmere tied with
the same were hanging from the bell-pull.</p>

<p>“A child!” said Floy to herself in increasing surprise,
as she went up the steps and gave a very gentle
ring.</p>

<p>The door was opened as usual by Kathleen, who
recognized our heroine with a faint, rather watery
smile.</p>

<p>“I’m plazed to see you, miss.”</p>

<p>“Who is dead, Kathleen?” Floy asked as she
stepped in and the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>“Sure, miss, an’ it’s just himself&mdash;the Madame’s
pet, that was always wid her night an’ day; an’ it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>’s
just breakin’ her heart about him she is, poor dear,
that hasn’t a chick nor a child left! An’ it’s sad an’
sore me own heart is whin I think o’ niver seeing the
little baste at its purty thricks no more.”</p>

<p>“Frisky, her lap-dog!” exclaimed Floy. “I
thought it must be a relative.”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, an’ sure she always thrated the little
baste like a Christian, an’ she’s kapin’ on wid that
now it’s dead.”</p>

<p>“What ailed it?”</p>

<p>“Well, miss, the docther he said ’twas just laziness
and over-feedin’&mdash;only he put it into grand
words, you know&mdash;and the Madame didn’t like it;
but it’s dead an’ gone he is, annyhow, the purty darlint!”</p>

<p>“Is it Miss Kemper?” asked Mary, appearing at
the head of the stairs. “Please walk right up,
miss.”</p>

<p>Floy was ushered at once into the Madame’s dressing-room,
where she found that lady weeping bitterly
over her dead favorite as it lay stiff and stark in
her lap.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, Miss Kemper!” she sobbed, looking
up piteously into Floy’s face, with the tears running
fast down her own; “he’s gone, my pretty darling&mdash;the
only thing I had left to love, and the only one
that had any love for poor me!”</p>

<p>The young girl scarcely knew what consolation to
offer; she could only express her sympathy and hope
that he might be replaced by another as pretty and
playful.</p>

<p>“Never, never!” exclaimed the Madame indignantly;
“no other ever could or ever shall fill his place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
And he shall have a splendid funeral,” she went
on, with a fresh burst of grief, “the finest casket
money can buy, and a white satin shroud; a monument
over his dear little grave too; and I’ll put on
mourning as I would for a child.”</p>

<p>For a moment Floy was silent with surprise; then
recovering herself,</p>

<p>“This is handsomer than satin, Madame,” she said,
gently touching the silky floss of the dog’s own natural
coat; “and what a pity to bury it: would it not
be better to have it stuffed? for then you need not
lose your pet entirely, but can keep him here, caress
him, and deck him with ribbons as you have been used
to doing.”</p>

<p>“Bless you for the suggestion!” cried the
mourner, drying her tears. “So I can; and it will
be better than hiding him away out of my sight.</p>

<p>“Mary, you needn’t send the order for the casket or
the digging of the grave; but, instead, go out at once
and inquire who is the best taxidermist in the city.”</p>

<p>Left alone with the Madame, Floy set herself to
the task of persuading her out of the absurd notion
of putting on mourning, her main argument being
that it was an unwholesome dress and the lady’s
health already poor enough.</p>

<p>“That is true; nobody knows what I suffer every
day of my life,” assented the Madame; “and as I’m
not going to quite lose the darling,” hugging the
dead dog lovingly in her arms as she spoke, “I’ll
give it up; that is, I’ll wear white instead; and you
shall stay all the same and make me some lovely
white morning dresses, tucked, ruffled, and trimmed
with elegant lace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>“How immense she will look in them!” was
Floy’s mental comment; but she wisely kept her
thoughts to herself.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mary was executing her commission
with such promptness and energy that within
an hour Frisky’s remains had been taken away&mdash;the
Madame parting from them with many tears and
caresses&mdash;and the insignia of mourning removed
from the outside of the house.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you enough, miss,”
the maid said aside to Floy. “It was just awful to
me&mdash;the idea of a grand funeral for a dog, and all
the neighbors lookin’ on an’ thinkin’ us a pack o’
fools. I wish in my heart you lived here all the
time, for you can do more to make the Madame hear
reason than all the rest of us put together.”</p>

<p>“Can that be so?” said Floy. “I should not have
expected my influence to be nearly so great as
yours.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said the maid, and Floy wondered at
the earnest, curious gaze she bent upon her.</p>

<p>Mary was thinking of the miniature to which the
young girl bore so strong a resemblance; but perceiving
that Floy observed her scrutiny, she turned
hastily away and left the room.</p>

<p>Several times afterward, during this sojourn in the
house, Floy was aware of a repetition of Mary’s
fixed, searching look, and that the Madame also, in
the pauses of her grief, regarded her more than once
in much the same manner.</p>

<p>Each time it struck our heroine as strange, but
she soon forgot it in thoughts of Espy or the lost
parent of whom she was still in quest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that she had not Frisky to take her attention,
the Madame took to poring over the miniature again,
often weeping bitterly the while; sometimes Mary
overheard such murmured words as these:</p>

<p>“Pansy, Pansy, my little Pansy! Oh, I can never
forgive myself! My darling, my darling!”</p>

<p>One morning Madame Le Conte awoke with a sudden
resolution, and surprised her maid with an unusual
order.</p>

<p>“Mary,” she said, “I shall call upon my solicitor
to-day. Tell Rory to have the carriage at the door
at eleven o’clock. Then bring me my breakfast and
dress me at once for the street.”</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” inquired Mary of herself as
she hastened downstairs in obedience to the order;
“is she going to make a will and leave a lot of
money to that pretty Miss Kemper? And all because
she looks like that picture in the locket?
Well, well, if it had only happened to be me now,
how lucky ’twould have been!”</p>

<p>Having come to her resolve, Madame Le Conte
was in feverish haste to carry it out, scolded because
her breakfast was not ready on the instant, and fretted
and fumed over her toilet, accusing Mary of being
intentionally and exasperatingly slow.</p>

<p>But the maid bore it with unruffled equanimity,
perhaps looking to the possibility of a fat legacy.</p>

<p>The Madame entered her carriage in a tremor of
excitement and haste, which, however, calmed down
somewhat during the drive.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination, Mary assisted her to
alight and ascend the three or four steps leading into
the hall of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop! it is this first door,” said the Madame,
panting and wheezing, slight as the exertion had
been. “Wait a minute till I recover breath. I want
a private interview, and you will stay outside. Rap
now.”</p>

<p>Mary obeyed, and hearing a loud “Come in!”
opened the door and stepped back to let her mistress
enter.</p>

<p>“Ah! Madame Le Conte! how d’ye do?” said the
lawyer, rising and offering a hand to his rich client;
then, with a sudden recollection, dropping it at his
side and contenting himself with pushing forward an
arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Madame,” he said. “You are quite
a stranger here, but I have been out of town, and
may have missed a call from you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she panted, “I’ve&mdash;not&mdash;been here since I
saw you last.”</p>

<p>“Ah? Well, my dear Madame, what can I do for
you to-day?”</p>

<p>“You have heard nothing&mdash;learned nothing yet?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever, as I am sorry to say.”</p>

<p>She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“I think I should give it up,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” she cried with vehemence. “I
would have you renew and redouble your efforts.”</p>

<p>“What can I do that has not already been done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but you must try to think of something.
Write a new advertisement; send it to every
paper in the land.”</p>

<p>“It will be putting you to very great expense, and
uselessly, I am almost sure.”</p>

<p>“That is my affair,” she wheezed, wiping the perspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
from her face with a delicate cambric handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, with a slight bow of acquiescence;
“the money is your own to use as you
please, but it is a pity to throw it away. And how
long have we been engaged in this search?”</p>

<p>“Ten years!” she sighed half despairingly;
“but,” brightening a little, “we’ve almost let it
drop for months past. I’d nearly lost heart, but we
must begin again and never mind expense. I’d give
half my fortune to succeed.”</p>

<p>“I wish you may; though I have not much hope
of it, I must confess,” he answered indifferently,
“but of course your instructions shall be promptly
carried out.”</p>

<p>Hetty and her mother had taken advantage of
the slack time to pay a long-promised visit to some
friends in the country, leaving to Mrs. Sharp the
oversight of domestic affairs and the care of the store,
with such assistance as she could get from Araminta
and Lucian, who were home for the summer vacation.</p>

<p>John was, as usual, spending his vacation in farm
work, while all the apprentices and journey-women
had left for the time being, except our heroine and
Annie Jones, who was an orphan and had neither
home nor friends to go to.</p>

<p>These two were kept pretty steadily employed
upon the few dresses of customers still on hand, and
in preparing Miss Sharp’s wardrobe for another year
at boarding-school.</p>

<p>One morning Floy, who had been left for an hour
or more sole occupant of the work-room, was startled
by the sudden entrance of Annie in a state bordering
on distraction.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do! what shall I do!” she cried,
wringing her hands and pacing the floor to and fro
with rapid steps, while great tears rolled down her
cheeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> “Oh, Miss Kemper, can you help me?”</p>

<p>“What is it, Annie?” Floy asked, stopping the
machine which she was running at the moment, and
turning upon the girl a look of mingled surprise and
pity. “Stop crying and tell me, and I will certainly
help you if I can. Have you offended Mrs.
Sharp?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and worse than that: she says I’ve
robbed her; but oh, I haven’t! I wouldn’t steal a
pin from anybody. But she won’t believe a word I
say, and she says if I don’t find the five dollars pretty
quick she’ll have me arrested and taken to prison;
and Lucian wants to go off for a policeman right
away. Oh dear, oh dear!”</p>

<p>The girl’s distress and agitation were so great that
Floy had some difficulty in coming to a clear understanding
of her trouble; but at length, by dint of
soothing and questioning, she learned the facts,
which were these:</p>

<p>Annie had been sent to carry home some finished
work, taking with her a receipted bill for thirty dollars,
her instructions being not to leave it unless it
was paid.</p>

<p>The woman, a Mrs. Collins, a new customer, handed
her twenty-five dollars, saying that she would pay
the rest at another time; and the girl, from stupidity,
carelessness, or bashfulness, allowed her to retain
the bill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp sent her back for it, but the woman refused
to give it up, and, to the astonishment and dismay
of the poor child, stoutly asserted that she had
paid the whole.</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Sharp accused Annie of retaining
the missing sum, and with much anger and indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
declared that she would send her to prison unless
she made good the loss within an hour.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Kemper,” sobbed the girl in conclusion,
“I haven’t a dollar or a friend in the world! and if
I lose my character what will become of me? Nobody’ll
trust me, and I can’t get work, and I’ll just
have to starve.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry for you,” said Floy; “but
trust in the Lord, and He will help you; and if you
are innocent, He will bring it to light some day.”</p>

<p>“If I am innocent! oh, Miss Floy,” sobbed the
girl, “you don’t think me a thief, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, Annie, I don’t, if that’s any comfort to you,
poor child!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that!” Annie said, a gleam of pleasure
flitting over her tear-swollen face, then burst out
again, “But oh, what shall I do? Oh, if I only had
five dollars! Miss Floy, can you lend it to me? I’ll
pay it back some day, and never, never forget to ask
God to bless you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“I would if I could, Annie, but I haven’t half that
sum,” Floy was beginning to say, when a sudden
recollection stopped her.</p>

<p>In the old pocket-book found upon Mr. Kemper’s
person after his death, and kept by her as a sacred
relic, she had safely stowed away the golden half-eagle
he had given her but a few moments before the
awful accident that had made her an almost penniless
orphan.</p>

<p>For herself she would not have spent it unless reduced
to the last extremity of want; but her noble,
generous heart could not withstand Annie’s appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait here a moment; I will see,” she said in
tremulous tones, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Up to her own she ran, locked herself in, opened
her trunk, and, diving to the bottom, drew forth
the old, worn, faded pocket-book.</p>

<p>For a moment she held it lovingly in her hand, hot
tears rushing to her eyes as she thought of that terrible
scene enacted scarce a year ago.</p>

<p>But the present was no time for the indulgence of
grief. She undid the clasp and looked for the treasure
she had come to seek.</p>

<p>Where was it? with fingers and eyes she examined
each division, yet without success. Had she
been robbed? A sudden pang shot through her
heart at the thought.</p>

<p>But oh no, that could not be! The lining was
much torn, and the coin had doubtless slipped in between
it and the outside.</p>

<p>She ran her fingers in and felt it there, and&mdash;something
else: a memorandum or bill probably. She
pulled at it, tore the lining a little more, and finally
drew out a bit of folded paper that looked like a leaf
torn from a note-book.</p>

<p>Her heart gave a wild throb, and in her excitement
the paper slipped from her fingers and fell to the
floor. She stooped and clutched it hastily, eagerly,
as if she feared it would even yet escape her; then,
with a strong effort at composure, opened out the
folds with her trembling fingers.</p>

<p>One glance told her that it was in very truth the
long-sought deed of gift.</p>

<p>She did not wait to read it in detail, but scanned
the lines hurriedly. The name&mdash;her mother’s name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and her own&mdash;was what she sought; and there it
was&mdash;“Ethel Farnese”&mdash;perfectly legible, though
evidently written with unsteady fingers, as of one in
great agitation of mind.</p>

<p>“Ethel Farnese!” repeated Floy half aloud, letting
the paper fall into her lap and clasping her
hands together over it, while with a far-off look in
her lustrous eyes she gazed into space. “Ethel
Farnese! and that is who I am; who she was when
she gave me to them! Ethel Farnese! I seem to
be not myself at all, but somebody else. How
strange it all is! just like a story or a dream.” And
for a moment she sat with her head upon her hand,
overcome by a curious sense of loss and bewilderment.
Was she the same girl who had come into that
room ten minutes ago?</p>

<p>Then a thought struck her. “The will! might it
not have shared the hiding-place of the deed? Oh,
what joy if she could but find <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>She caught up the pocket-book again, the color coming
and going in her cheeks, her heart beating so fast
she could hardly breathe, and with remorseless fingers
tore it apart till not a fold or crevice remained unexplored;
but alas! without any further discovery.</p>

<p>“Ah, he never made it!” she sighed sadly to herself,
as she had done months before.</p>

<p>She restored the pocket-book to its place, with the
deed of gift safely bestowed inside, locked her trunk,
and with the gold piece in her hand returned to the
work-room.</p>

<p>Annie, pacing to and fro with agitated steps, was
still its only occupant. “Oh, I thought you’d never
come!” she cried, stopping in her walk and turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
eagerly to Floy. “Have you got the money for
me? What’s the matter? you look as if something
had happened.”</p>

<p>“I have the money&mdash;a five-dollar gold piece which
I value so highly as a keepsake that I would not
spend it for myself unless I were in absolute danger
of starvation,” Floy said, answering the first query,
ignoring the other; “still I will lend it to you if
necessary to save you from arrest. But, Annie,
wouldn’t your paying the money to Mrs. Sharp look
like an acknowledgment that you had really kept it
back, as she says?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; maybe it would,” sobbed Annie,
“but she’ll send me to jail if I don’t. I don’t like
to take your keepsake either; but oh dear, oh dear!
what shall I do?”</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Sharp came hastily into the
room. She was a quick-tempered woman, but not
hard-hearted, and, her anger having had time to cool,
began now to relent toward the friendless girl who
had offended her. Still she did not like to retreat
from the position she had taken.</p>

<p>“Well, Annie, what are you going to do?” she
asked in a tone whose mildness surprised the child.
“I hope you’ve concluded to give up the money
you’ve held back from me. You may as well, for
it won’t do you any good to keep it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I would if I had it!” sobbed Annie, “but
that woman never gave me a cent more than what I
handed to you; and if you don’t believe me you can
search me and my trunk.”</p>

<p>“Humph! there are other places where you could
hide it,” was the quick, sarcastic rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Kemper,” turning to Floy, “what do <em>you</em>
think of this business?”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that Annie would rob you,
Mrs. Sharp, though she did wrong in leaving the
bill contrary to directions, and therefore might in
strict justice be required to make good your loss,”
said Floy. “And I think she is willing to do it if
it were in her power; but you know she has no
money, and no way of earning any just now.”</p>

<p>“Well, she soon will be getting wages,” said Mrs.
Sharp meditatively, “and if she’ll agree that I
shall keep the first five dollars&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will, I will!” interrupted Annie, catching
eagerly at the suggestion and clasping her hands in
passionate entreaty, “indeed I will, if you’ll only believe
I didn’t take it, and let me stay on here! And
I’ll never forget your kindness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp gave a somewhat ungracious consent
that it should be so; and hearing a customer enter
the store, hurried back to wait upon her, while the
relieved Annie dried her eyes and took up the work
she had dropped when sent upon the unfortunate
errand.</p>

<p>That she was spared the parting with her prized
souvenir was certainly a pleasure and relief to Floy,
but the remembrance of that was soon lost in the
excitement of her recent discovery; her thoughts
were full of it, and with joy she said to herself,
“Here is another step taken toward the finding of
my mother. I am more convinced than ever that
she still lives, and that the good God who has
helped me thus far will finally guide me to her; for
now, knowing the name she once bore, I can advertise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in a way much more likely to attract her attention.”</p>

<p>But here a great obstacle&mdash;the want of money&mdash;presented
itself, and the girl’s busy brain set to work
to contrive ways and means to earn the needful
funds.</p>

<p>The treasured half-eagle would not go very far,
and it, she quickly decided, must be kept as a reserve
in case of dire necessity.</p>

<p>The question arose in her mind whether she
should now drop her adopted name and resume that
which was hers by right of birth.</p>

<p>But such a course would involve explanations and
confidences which she did not care to give to those
about her&mdash;these people who would feel no interest
in them or in her but that of idle curiosity. Hetty
was the only member of the family who knew, or
had ever shown any desire to know, anything of
Floy’s history or hopes, and our heroine quickly
decided that until Hetty returned this secret should
be all her own.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>But Floy’s resolve was destined to be speedily
swallowed up in the current of swiftly-coming
events.</p>

<p>Only two days later, after some hours spent down
town in the fatiguing business of shopping for Araminta
Sharp, going from store to store in search of
exact matches in dress goods, trimmings, and ribbons,
she was standing on a corner waiting for a
street-car, when a ragged little newsboy accosted
her with:</p>

<p>“I say, miss, won’t you buy one o’ these here
papers?” running over the names of several of the
dailies; “I hain’t sold none to-day, and if I don’t
have better luck Teddy an’ me (that’s my little lame
brother) we’ll have to go hungry and sleep in the
street.”</p>

<p>“That would be hard. Give me one, I don’t
care which,” Floy said hastily, signalling the approaching
car.</p>

<p>“Thank ’ee, miss!” said the boy as she dropped
the pennies into his hand.</p>

<p>Seated in the car, she scanned the news items,
skipping the police reports and the details of “the
murder,” read the editorials, then ran her eye down
the columns of advertisements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>It lighted on something that nearly startled her
into an outcry. Could it be? did not her eyes deceive
her?</p>

<p>She closed them for an instant in her excitement,
almost holding her breath, while her heart beat tumultuously,
the color came and went on her cheek,
and she trembled until the paper shook in her hands;
then opened them again to see it still staring her
in the face&mdash;that name, her name, which only two
days ago she had learned was hers.</p>

<p>“If Ethel Farnese&mdash;wife or widow of Adrian X.
Farnese, and formerly of Jefferson, Clinton County,
Indiana&mdash;or her heirs will open communication with
Messrs. Tredick &amp; Server, Attorneys at Law, No. &mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Street,
Chicago, they will learn something to their advantage.”</p>

<p>How much that short paragraph told her! how
much that was to her of intense interest, of great
importance: her father’s Christian name, the former
residence of her parents, and that some one else
(who could it be?) was engaged in the same quest
as herself!</p>

<p>Unless (but the idea of such a possibility did not
occur to her at the moment, and when it did was
quickly discarded) some other Ethel Farnese than
her mother were intended.</p>

<p>No one was observing our heroine, no one noticed
her agitation, and she had time to partially recover
from it before facing the uncongenial and indifferent
inmates of the house which was her temporary home.</p>

<p>Though inwardly in a whirl of excitement, she
contrived to preserve a calm exterior while in the
presence of the family, giving sufficient attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the duties required of her to go through them in a
creditable manner.</p>

<p>But it was a great relief when at last she was left
free to follow her own inclinations and could seek
the solitude of the room which she occupied alone
in the absence of Mrs. Goodenough and Hetty.</p>

<p>This was not till her usual hour for retiring, but
in her present mood sleep was simply out of the
question. She sought her pillow indeed, but lay
awake the greater part of the night thinking, planning,
and full of conjectures as to the revelations
which the near future might have in store for her.</p>

<p>She had no earthly friend to go to for advice,
but had learned to seek guidance and direction from
that Friend who is ever-present with His children
wherever they may be.</p>

<p>From early childhood she had always known
her own mind, and circumstances during the past
year had done much to develop and increase this
natural tendency to self-reliance and independence
of thought and action.</p>

<p>She rose in the morning with her plans arranged,
and quite ready to carry them out with promptness
and decision. As a preliminary she surprised Mrs.
Sharp by telling her as she rose from the breakfast-table,
after an almost untasted meal, that she must
have the day to herself; she had some matters of her
own to attend to, and knew she could be spared, the
sewing for Araminta being about done and nothing
else at all pressing.</p>

<p>Hardly waiting for a reply, in her haste and excitement,
she left the room.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! mighty independent, to be sure!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
What’s in the wind now, I wonder!” exclaimed Mrs.
Sharp, setting down the cup she had just lifted to
her lips, and looking after Floy’s retreating figure.</p>

<p>But Floy did not hear. Repairing to her own
room, Floy arrayed herself in her best attire&mdash;a suit
of deep mourning, simply made and inexpensive,
but very pretty and becoming&mdash;and, armed with all
the documents at her command which could help to
establish her identity, wended her way to the street
and number named in the advertisement.</p>

<p>She had no difficulty in finding the place; the
name of the firm was on the outside of the building,
and repeated on the first door to the right as she
passed into the hall.</p>

<p>A voice bade her enter in answer to her knock.
She did so with a noiseless step and quiet, lady-like
air.</p>

<p>The room was of good size and handsomely furnished;
evidently Messrs. Tredick &amp; Server were a
prosperous firm.</p>

<p>They were both there, seated each at his own desk.
Both looked up and bowed good-morning, while one,
the nearest to her, Mr. Server, as she afterwards
learned, rose and handed her a chair, asking,
“What can I do for you, Miss&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ethel Farnese,” replied Floy as he paused for
the name, her cheek flushing, the low, sweet tones of
her refined voice slightly tremulous.</p>

<p>What audacity it seemed in her thus to take quiet
possession of a name she had never before so much
as heard pronounced!</p>

<p>At that both lawyers pricked up their ears, a look
of surprised satisfaction coming into their faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Server, extending his hand;
“then we are most happy to see you. But can it be
the Mrs. Ethel Farnese for whom we have been so
long advertising? so young&mdash;her daughter, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“For her or her heirs, was it not?” Floy quietly
asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, certainly! and you bring proofs of
your identity, doubtless? You come from your
mother? or&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, glancing inquiringly at her deep
mourning.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have documents to show&mdash;a story to
tell,” Floy said, ignoring the last query; “have
you leisure to hear it now?”</p>

<p>“We have; no time like the present,” said Server
briskly, drawing his chair nearer, while his partner
came forward with an air of keen interest and
joined them.</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce Mr. Tredick, Miss Farnese,”
said Server; “and now let us proceed to
business,” he added as Tredick, having shaken
hands with Floy, took a seat at his side. “What
have you to show us?”</p>

<p>“This,” replied Floy, putting the deed of gift
into his hand.</p>

<p>He examined it curiously.</p>

<p>“Ah! your mother gave you away?” he said,
elevating his eyebrows and glancing inquiringly at
her as he passed the paper on to Mr. Tredick.</p>

<p>“You shall hear how and why presently,” she
said. “First let me prove that I am the child
adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Kemper,” and she handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Mr. Server a package, saying, “These are letters
addressed to me by my legal adviser, Mr. Crosby, of
Cranley, Iowa.”</p>

<p>“What! my old friend Crosby?” exclaimed Mr.
Tredick. “Ah! I know his hand, and if he indorses
you you’re all right. Yes, yes, these are genuine!”
he added, glancing over the letters as Server
opened and spread them before his eyes. “I see
they are directed and addressed to Miss Floy Kemper;
and he alludes here to your search for your
mother. My dear young lady, let us have your
story. Your mother, I conclude, is still living? My
client will be overjoyed to hear it.”</p>

<p>“I do not know; I hope so, sir,” Floy answered
with emotion.</p>

<p>Then calming herself by a determined effort, she
went on to give a brief statement of such facts as
were necessary to establish her own identity, vindicate
her mother from any suspicion of want of
love for her child, and show what reason there was
for believing, or at least hoping, that she still lived.</p>

<p>She passed very lightly over her own sorrows, and
said nothing of her struggles with poverty.</p>

<p>They heard her to the end without interruption, and
evidently with deep interest, especially as she detailed
her efforts to trace her lost parent, and what she
had learned of that parent’s history while doing so.</p>

<p>Their faces lighted up with satisfaction as she
closed with the information gleaned from Mrs.
Dobbs.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Mr. Tredick, rubbing his hands and
showing a fine set of false teeth, “I begin to see a
little light. You deserve a great deal of credit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
your exertions&mdash;the energy and wisdom with which
they have been made, Miss Farnese.”</p>

<p>“It was God’s good providence, sir, not any
wisdom of mine,” she answered with quiet simplicity.</p>

<p>“May I ask if you were brought up by the Kempers
with the knowledge that you were their child
only by adoption?” queried Mr. Server.</p>

<p>“I had not the slightest suspicion of it till my&mdash;Mrs.
Kemper revealed the fact to me with her dying
breath,” Floy answered in a voice that trembled
with almost overpowering emotion.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said, with a touch of compassion
in his tones and a second glance at her mourning
dress, “your loss has been recent, I fear?”</p>

<p>She bowed a silent assent.</p>

<p>“And you were ignorant of your true mother’s
name?” pursued Mr. Tredick, modulating his voice
to express sympathy in her sorrow; “had you not
then this deed of gift in your possession?”</p>

<p>Floy told of her vain search of last year, and her
recent discovery.</p>

<p>“Are you now satisfied of my identity?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Perfectly; and it is your turn to question us.
Do you not wish to learn who has been engaged in
the same quest as yourself?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed!” she replied with earnest animation.</p>

<p>“Your mother had a sister,” he said. “The two
were entirely alone in the world after the death of
their parents, which occurred before your mother&mdash;the
younger one&mdash;was quite grown up. In time both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
married. The husbands quarrelled, the sisters became
estranged (each, it is to be presumed, taking
part with her husband), and there was a separation.
Your father carried his wife off to parts unknown,
and the sister, my client, has heard nothing
of her since, though for the last ten years, during
which she has been a wealthy, childless widow, she
has used every effort to find her. All this occurred
before your birth, and she is still in ignorance of the
fact that her sister ever became a mother.”</p>

<p>Floy sat with her hands clasped in her lap, her
large, lustrous eyes fixed intently upon the speaker,
her breathing hurried, the full red lips slightly
parted, a rich, varying color on her softly-rounded
cheek.</p>

<p>“She is very pretty,” thought Server, watching
her furtively; “very like the descriptions I have
heard of Mrs. Farnese.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tredick paused, and the girl drew a long,
sighing breath.</p>

<p>“Where is my aunt? When may I see her?”
she asked, vainly striving to be calm and composed.</p>

<p>“She is in this city. I will send for a hack and
take you to her at once, if you will allow me to
do so.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“Your aunt is an invalid, I regret to say,” Mr.
Tredick remarked as they drove rapidly through the
streets, “and we must not come upon her too suddenly
with this good news. I shall have to ask you,
Miss Farnese, to take a seat in the parlor below
while I seek a private interview with her in her boudoir.”</p>

<p>Our heroine bowed in acquiescence, and he went
on:</p>

<p>“It will not take long to break the matter to her,
and you are not likely to be kept waiting many minutes.”</p>

<p>“Please do not concern yourself about that,” she
said; “I should prefer to be kept waiting for hours
rather than run the slightest risk of injury to the
only relative I am certain of possessing in all the
world.”</p>

<p>The girl seemed composed&mdash;the lawyer thought
her so, and rather wondered at such an amount of
self-control in one so young&mdash;but inwardly she was
full of agitation and excitement.</p>

<p>Her lonely heart yearned for the love and companionship
of kindred, yet dreaded to find in this
unknown relative one who might prove wholly uncongenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and even repulsive. She remembered
that she was not yet of age, and was about to place
herself under authority of which she knew nothing.
There might be conflict of tastes and opinions on
very vital subjects. Yet she had no thought of
drawing back. She had weighed the matter carefully,
viewed it in all its aspects, had decided that
this was her wisest and best course, and was ready to
pursue it unfalteringly to the end.</p>

<p>So wholly absorbed in these thoughts and emotions
was she that she took no note of the direction
in which they were moving, nor what streets they
traversed.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped. Mr. Tredick threw open
the door, sprang out, and, turning, assisted her to
alight.</p>

<p>He led her up the steps of a large and handsome
dwelling, and rang the bell. She glanced about her,
and started with surprise. The street, the house,
everything within range of her vision, had a
strangely familiar look.</p>

<p>They had reached the suburbs of the city, and before
them&mdash;as they stood on the threshold, looking
out toward the east&mdash;lay the great lake, quiet as a
sleeping child, under the fervid rays of the sun of
that still summer day, one of the calmest and most
sultry of the season. A second glance around, and
Floy&mdash;as we must still call her&mdash;turned to her conductor
with an eager question on her lips.</p>

<p>But the door opened, a smiling face appeared, and
a cheery voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Is it you, Misther Tredick, sir? Will ye plaze
to walk in, and I’ll run up an’ tell the Madame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
She’s dressed and ready to resave ye, by good
luck.</p>

<p>“An’ the lady too,” added Kathleen, catching a
sight of Floy, but without recognizing her, her face
being partially concealed by her veil.</p>

<p>“Step intil the parlor, both o’ yees, plaze, an’
who shall I say wishes to see the Madame?” she
asked, with another and curious glance at the veiled
lady.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tredick,” said that gentleman, giving her
his card; “don’t mention the lady at all. She will
wait here till I come down again. Just tell the
Madame that Mr. Tredick wishes to see her a moment
on business.”</p>

<p>But Mary’s voice spoke from the stairhead,
“Katty, the Madame says ask the gentleman to walk
right up,” and Mr. Tredick, hearing, awaited no
second invitation.</p>

<p>Floy’s brain was in a whirl.</p>

<p>“The Madame? the Madame?” she repeated in
low, agitated tones, dropping into a chair in the luxuriously-furnished
parlor, but with no thought of its
richly-carved, costly wood and velvet cushions.
“My aunt must be visiting here. But ’twas for the
Madame he asked, ’twas the Madame he wished to
see! Can it be that she&mdash;she is&mdash; Yes, it must&mdash;it
is!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands, with a slight shudder
and something between a groan and a sigh.</p>

<p>The poor Madame had never been an attractive
person to Floy; she was not one whom she could
greatly respect or look up to for comfort in sorrow,
for guidance in times of doubt and perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>In finding her she had not found one who would
at all fill the place of the parents she mourned, and
whose loss had left her without an earthly counsellor,
an earthly prop.</p>

<p>In the bitterness of her disappointment she learned
how much she had been half unconsciously hoping
for. The pressure of poverty had been sorely felt by
the young girl during these past months, but was as
nothing to the yearning for the tender love and care
and happy trustfulness that had been the crowning
blessing of earlier days.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte received her legal adviser that
morning in her boudoir, rising from her easy chair
in her eager haste to learn if he were the bearer of
tidings, and coming forward to meet him as he entered.</p>

<p>“What news, Mr. Tredick? I see in your face
that you have some for me!” she cried, almost
breathless with excitement and the exertion, slight
as it was.</p>

<p>“Ah! are you so skilled in reading faces?” he returned
playfully. “Well, I own that I have a bit of
news for you&mdash;good news as far as it goes. But let
me beg you to be seated and calm yourself before I
proceed further.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on, go on! don’t keep me in suspense!”
she cried in increasing agitation, sinking into her
chair again and pointing him to a seat as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Remember it is good news,” he repeated, taking
up a large feather fan and beginning to fan her
flushed cheeks, while Mary brought her smelling-salts
and asked if she would have a glass of water.</p>

<p>She made a gesture of refusal, and pointed to the
door opening into her dressing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl at once obeyed the hint and went out,
closing the door after her.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Tredick, speak, speak!” exclaimed
the Madame imperatively. “Have you heard anything
of&mdash;of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your sister? No&mdash;yes; that is, nothing recent,
but I have just learned that she has a daughter living
at no great distance from this. Shall I send for the
girl?”</p>

<p>“Send for her? How could you wait to ask?
Why did you delay a moment when you know that
I’m dying with longing for the sight of somebody
who has a drop of my blood in her veins?” she interrupted
in great excitement and anger.</p>

<p>“Only for your own sake, Madame,” he answered
deprecatingly. “Knowing the precarious
state of your health&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t stop to talk!” she cried, half rising
from her chair. “Where is she? She must be sent
for this instant! As if I could wait, and my sister’s
child within reach! Mary must run down and
order the carriage at once.”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, my dear Madame,” he said soothingly.
“I have anticipated your wishes so far as to
make arrangements for the young lady to be here
within an hour from this time,” consulting his
watch, “and in the mean while I must lay before you
the proofs of her identity, and have your opinion as
to their being altogether satisfactory and convincing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you have decided that they are, it’s quite
sufficient,” she answered with a sort of weary impatience;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>“you would be less easily deceived than I.”</p>

<p>“But we may as well fill up the time with the examination;
and you will be glad to learn something
of your sister’s history after your separation?” he
remarked persuasively, taking from his pocket the
papers Floy had given him.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, yes!” she cried with eagerness. “I
did not understand that you had that to communicate
to me. Ah, Pansy, Pansy! my poor little
Pansy!” and covering her face with her handkerchief,
she sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear Madame, cheer up!” he said,
“she is still living&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, is she? is she?” she again interrupted him,
starting up wildly. “But why don’t you go on?
why will you keep me in this torturing suspense?”</p>

<p>“I am trying to go on as fast as I can,” he said
a little impatiently. “I was about to correct my
last statement by saying we have at least reason to
hope that your sister still lives, and that we shall yet
find her.”</p>

<p>“But the girl&mdash;the daughter&mdash;have you seen her?
and doesn’t she know all about her mother?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame; but if you want to hear the facts,
as far as I have been able to gather them, your best
plan will be to listen quietly to what I have to say.
There is quite a little story to be told, and one that
cannot fail to be of interest to you.”</p>

<p>Of interest! The Madame almost held her breath
lest she should lose a syllable of the narrative as he
went on to describe the scenes enacted in the shanty
inn and depot at Clearfield Station, in which her
sister had borne so conspicuous a part.</p>

<p>Then he showed her the deed of gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she said, pointing to the signature,
“that is my poor Ethel’s handwriting. I should
recognize it anywhere. It was always peculiar.
Oh, where is the child?”</p>

<p>“Downstairs in the parlor. Shall I call her?
shall I bring her to you?”</p>

<p>She was too much moved to speak. She nodded
assent.</p>

<p>In a moment more Floy stood before her.</p>

<p>The Madame gave a cry of mingled joy and surprise,
and held out her arms.</p>

<p>“Is it you&mdash;<em>you</em>? oh, I am glad! I am the happiest
woman alive!”</p>

<p>Floy knelt down by her side and suffered herself
to be enfolded by the stout arms, pressed against
the broad breast, kissed and cried over.</p>

<p>She had meditated upon Madame’s sufferings from
loneliness and disease till her heart was melted with
pity. She had thought upon the fact that the same
blood flowed in their veins&mdash;that this was the sister,
the only, and probably dearly loved, sister of the
unknown yet beloved mother of whom she was in
quest&mdash;till a feeling akin to affection had sprung up
within her.</p>

<p>“My poor dear aunt,” she whispered, twining her
arms about the Madame’s neck and imprinting a kiss
upon her lips, “what a dreary, lonely life you have
had! God helping me, I will make it happier than it
has been.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, child!” returned her new-found relative,
repeating her caress with added tenderness; “and
you, you poor darling! shall never have to toil for
your bread any more. Ah, what a delight it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to me to lavish on you every desirable thing that
money can buy! It is Miss Kemper, but it is my little
Pansy too; did I not see the likeness from the
first?” and the tears coursed down the Madame’s
swarthy cheeks.</p>

<p>“Why do you call me that?” asked Floy.</p>

<p>“It was my pet name for my sister. She was so
sweet and pretty, so modest, gentle, and retiring.
And she called me Tulip, because, as she said, my
beauty was gorgeous, like that of the flower. You
would not think it now; there’s not a trace of it
left,” she added, with a heavy sigh and a rueful
glance into a pier-glass opposite.</p>

<p>It was all quite true. Nannette Gramont (that was
the Madame’s maiden name) had a sylph-like form, a
rich brunette complexion, sparkling eyes, ruby lips,
a countenance and manners full of vivacity and
mirth.</p>

<p>Now she was dull and spiritless; her eye had lost
its brightness; the once smiling mouth wore a fretful
expression; the smooth, clear skin had grown sallow
and disfigured by pimples and blotches not to be
concealed by the most liberal use of powder and
rouge, poor substitute for the natural bloom which
had disappeared forever under the combined influence
of high living, indulged temper, remorse and
consequent ill-health, far more than advancing
years.</p>

<p>“You were not alike then?” Floy said, with a
secret sense of relief.</p>

<p>“No, no! never in the least, in looks or disposition.
I was always quick-tempered and imperious,
Ethel so gentle and yielding that we never quarrelled&mdash;never till&mdash;ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
I cannot endure the thought
of it!” And burying her face in her handkerchief,
the Madame wept bitterly.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no sound in the room but
her heavy sobbing, Floy feeling quite at a loss for
words of consolation; but at last she said softly:</p>

<p>“One so gentle and sweet would never harbor resentment,
especially toward a dear, only sister.”</p>

<p>“No, no; but it has parted us forever&mdash;this unkindness
of mine! And it may be that she&mdash;my
sweet one, my dear one&mdash;has perished with want,
while I rolled in wealth. Ah, me! what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I believe she is living still, and that we shall yet
find her!” cried Floy, starting up in excitement
and pacing to and fro, her hands clasped over her
beating heart, her eyes shining with hope.</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said the Madame, wiping away
her tears. “Child, would you like to see your
mother’s face?” She drew out of her bosom the little
gold locket which of late she had worn almost
constantly, and opening it, held it out to Floy.</p>

<p>In an instant the young girl was again on her knees
at her aunt’s side, bending over that pretty child-face,
one strangely like it in feature and coloring, yet unlike
in its eager curiosity, its tremulous agitation, the
yearning tenderness in the great, dark, lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>“How sweet! how lovely!” she said, raising her
eyes to her aunt’s face again. “But ah, if I could
see her as she was when grown up!”</p>

<p>“Look in the glass and you will,” said the
Madame.</p>

<p>Floy’s face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>The Madame opened the other side of the locket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>“This was of me, taken at the same time,” she
said, displaying the likeness of a girl some six or
eight years older in appearance than the first; bright
and handsome too, but with a darker beauty, and a
proud, wilful expression in place of the sweet gentleness
of the other. “Our mother had them painted
for herself. After her death I claimed the locket as
mine by right of priority of birth, and though Pansy
wished very much to have it, she yielded to me for
peace’s sake, as usual.”</p>

<p>“You, too, were a very pretty child, Mad&mdash;” Floy
broke off in confusion.</p>

<p>“Aunt Nannette,” corrected the Madame, with a
slight smile, passing her hand caressingly over the
soft, shining hair of her newly-found niece. “Aunt
Nannette, or simply auntie, as you like, my little
Pansy.”</p>

<p>There was an earnest, unspoken entreaty in Floy’s
eyes as she glanced from the locket to her aunt’s
face.</p>

<p>“There is hardly anything I would refuse you, little
one,” the Madame said in answer, “but this I
cannot part with. I will have them copied for you,
though; and the locket itself shall be enough handsomer
to more than compensate for the pictures being
only copies of the original.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tredick, having accomplished his mission by
breaking the good news to Madame Le Conte and
ushering Floy into her presence, quietly withdrew,
and, leaving a message with Mary to the intent that
he would call again the next morning, returned to his
office.</p>

<p>This was a memorable day in Floy’s life, the turning
of a new page in her history.</p>

<p>Mary was presently despatched with a note to Mrs.
Sharp briefly stating the facts, and with orders to
bring away the few effects of the young girl which
were there.</p>

<p>The news created a great sensation in the Sharp
household, as Mary duly reported on her return, telling
her story in a way which showed that she had
keenly enjoyed her part in the scene, and that she
was delighted to know that our heroine was no
longer a mere transient sojourner in the Madame’s
house.</p>

<p>Floy, in her capacity of dressmaker, had won
golden opinions from the servants, and both were
scarcely less pleased than astonished at the strange
turn affairs had taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s perfectly amazin’, as I told ’em down there,”
said Mary in conclusion. “Who’d have thought
that day you came here, lookin’ so sweet and sad in
your black dress, to make that new gownd for the
Madame, that you’d more real right in the house
than any of us except the Madame herself!”</p>

<p>“I hope she will never need to look so sad again,”
said Madame Le Conte, gazing with fond pride at the
pretty face of her niece. “My dear, would you be
willing to lay off your mourning now for my sake?”</p>

<p>The request caused such a flood of sad and tender
memories that for a moment Floy was utterly unable
to speak.</p>

<p>“I long to see you dressed as your mother used to
be at your age,” the Madame went on. “She
usually wore white gowns with pink or blue ribbons,
and it was sweetly becoming.”</p>

<p>Floy conquered herself with a strong effort.</p>

<p>“I will, Aunt Nannette; I would do more than that
to give you pleasure,” she said, with a winning smile,
though tears trembled in her eyes and a bright drop
rolled down her cheek as she spoke.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte saw it, and appreciated the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Dear child!” she said, “I see you are going to
be a great comfort to me. I am no longer alone in
the world, thank fortune! nor are you. It was a
happy chance that brought us together at last, wasn’t
it, dear?”</p>

<p>“A kind Providence, aunt,” Floy responded in
cheerful tones, “and I am very glad and thankful
to know that I have at least one living relative in the
world. And a good home,” she added, with a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
smile. “I have not been cast adrift for a year without
learning the value of that.”</p>

<p>It was a double house, and Floy had been already
assigned a suite of spacious, elegantly-furnished
apartments on the opposite side of the hall from the
Madame’s own, and also told that she was to be joint
mistress with her aunt, take the oversight of the domestic
affairs, order what she pleased for her meals,
and make free use of domestics, carriage and horses,
the grand piano in the parlor, the library&mdash;in short,
everything belonging to the establishment.</p>

<p>Floy was touched by this kindness and generosity
of her aunt, and felt that she might well be willing
to make some sacrifices to confer pleasure in return.
This feeling was increased tenfold by the occurrences
of the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredick called according to appointment, was
for a short time closeted with the Madame in her
boudoir; then Floy was summoned to join them,
when, to her amazement, she learned that her aunt
had made over to her property in bonds, stocks, and
mortgages to the amount of one hundred thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The girl’s first impulse was to return it with the idea
that Madame Le Conte was impoverishing herself,
and forgetful that other heirs might yet be found.
Grateful tears filled her eyes; she was too much
overcome to speak for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is a very generous gift,” the lawyer said, looking
at her in surprise at her silence.</p>

<p>“Generous? it is far too much!” Floy burst out,
finding her voice. “Dear aunt, what have you left
for yourself? and have you not forgotten that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
mother may be living and may have children by her
second husband, who will be quite as nearly related
to you as I?”</p>

<p>“No, child, take it. I have plenty left for myself
and them,” the Madame answered, with a pleased
laugh.</p>

<p>“That is quite true, my dear young lady,” remarked
Mr. Tredick; “for though I consider this a
generous gift for Madame Le Conte to bestow during
her lifetime, it is not one fifth of what she is
worth.”</p>

<p>Floy rose hastily and came to the side of her
aunt’s easy chair.</p>

<p>“Ah, little one! are you satisfied now to take and
enjoy it?” the Madame asked, touching the fair
young cheek caressingly as the girl bent over her
with features working with emotion.</p>

<p>It was not so much the abundant wealth so suddenly
showered upon her as the affection she saw in
the act of its bestowal which overcame Floy, so sweet
was love to the lonely heart that for a year past had
known so dreary a dearth of it.</p>

<p>“I will, dear auntie,” she said, smiling through
her fast-falling tears. “But what return can I make
for all your generous kindness?”</p>

<p>“My generous kindness!” the Madame repeated
in a tone of contempt; then at some sad memory a
look of keen distress swept over her face, and her
voice grew low and husky. “It is a small atonement
for the past,” she said, “the past that can
never be recalled!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tredick was busied with some legal document,
and seemed quite oblivious of what was passing between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the ladies. Presently he folded the paper up,
handed it, with several others, to Floy with the smiling
injunction to keep them carefully, inquired of the
Madame if she had any further commands for him,
and, receiving a reply in the negative, bowed himself
out.</p>

<p>As the door closed on her solicitor, the Madame
lifted a tiny silver bell from the table at her side and
tapped it lightly.</p>

<p>“The carriage waits, ladies,” said Mary, appearing
in answer.</p>

<p>“Then we will go at once,” returned her mistress.
“Pansy, my dear, put on your hat.”</p>

<p>A heavy rain during the night had wrought a sudden
and delightful change in the temperature of the
atmosphere; light clouds still partially obscured the
sun, and a fresh breeze was blowing from the lake.
The ladies had voted it a fine day for shopping, and
decided to avail themselves of it for that purpose.</p>

<p>A few moments later they were bowling rapidly
along toward the business part of the city in the
Madame’s elegant, easily-rolling, softly-cushioned
carriage, drawn by a pair of handsome, spirited
grays, the pride of Rory’s heart.</p>

<p>They returned some hours after laden with great
store of costly and beautiful things which Madame
Le Conte had insisted upon heaping on her niece.</p>

<p>There were several ready-made dresses, and in one
of these Floy made her appearance at the tea-table
spread for herself and aunt in the boudoir of the
latter.</p>

<p>The robe was white; a fine French muslin,
trimmed with beautiful lace. Floy had fastened it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the throat with a pale pink rose, and placed another
among the glossy braids of her dark brown hair.</p>

<p>“Ah, how lovely you look, my darling!” the Madame
exclaimed, gazing upon her in delighted admiration.
Then, the tears springing to her eyes, “I
could almost believe that my little Pansy of other
days stands before me,” she said.</p>

<p>While they were at the table her eyes continually
sought her niece’s face, and when they left it she
called for her jewel-box, saying, “You must let me
add something to your attire, Pansy.”</p>

<p>The Madame had a great fondness for gold and
precious stones, and Floy’s eyes opened wide in astonishment
and admiration at the store of diamonds,
pearls, rubies, emeralds, amethysts, and sapphires,
adorning brooches, ear-rings, finger-rings, chains,
and necklaces shortly spread before her.</p>

<p>“Have I not a fine collection?” asked their owner,
gloating over them with intense satisfaction. “Take
your choice, Pansy; take any or all you want; they
will probably all belong to you some day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! I should be astonished at such
an offer, auntie, had you not already shown yourself
so wonderfully generous,” said Floy, coloring with
pleasure. “But am I not too young to wear such
things?”</p>

<p>“Not pearls, at all events,” said the Madame,
throwing a beautiful necklace, composed of several
strands of very large and fine ones, about the young
girl’s neck, then adding bracelets, brooch, and ear-rings
to match.</p>

<p>“Oh, auntie, what a present! they are too lovely
for anything!” cried Floy in delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>“This, too, you must have,” said the Madame,
putting a jewel-case into her hand.</p>

<p>Floy opened it with eager curiosity. It contained
a gold chain and a tiny gold watch, both ornamented
with pearls.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked the Madame.</p>

<p>“Like it!” cried Floy; “I am charmed with it!
I have always wanted a watch, but never had one.
My dear adopted father had promised me one on my
eighteenth birthday, but I was all alone in the world
before that came,” she added, her voice sinking low
and trembling with emotion.</p>

</div>

<p>Madame Le Conte had missed her afternoon nap,
and was much fatigued by the unusual exertions and
excitement of the day.</p>

<p>It was quite early when she dismissed her niece for
the night&mdash;so early that as Floy (or Ethel, as we
should perhaps now call her) passed into her own
apartments and stood for a moment before a window
of her bedroom looking toward the west, she saw
that the glow of the sunset had not yet faded from
the sky.</p>

<p>She, too, was weary, but felt no disposition to seek
her pillow yet, though the bed with its snowy drapery
looked very inviting.</p>

<p>She was glad to be alone; she wanted time to collect
her thoughts, to compose her mind after the constant
whirl of excitement of the past two days.</p>

<p>Her spirit was buoyant with hope to-night; she
would find her long-lost mother, and Espy would
find her; for that he would search for her, that he
would be true to her, she never doubted.</p>

<p>And there was no bar to their union now; now
that she was possessed of twice the fortune she had
resigned, Mr. Alden would be only too glad to give
consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>The blissful certainty of that was the greatest happiness
this sudden gift of wealth had brought or
could bring to her.</p>

<p>But there were minor ones which she was far from
despising. She thought with a thrill of joy of the
ability it gave her to show her gratitude and affection
to those who had befriended her in adversity,
and to relieve poverty and distress.</p>

<p>And then the removal of the necessity of laboring
for her own support&mdash;what a relief it was! what a
delightful sense of ease and freedom she was conscious
of, as, turning from the window, she glanced at
her luxurious surroundings and remembered that she
would not be called up in the morning to a day of
toil; that she might choose her own hours for rising
and retiring; that she would have time and opportunity
for the cultivation of mind and heart, for the
keeping up of her accomplishments, and for many
innocent pleasures that want of means had obliged
her to forego during the past year!</p>

<p>The communicating doors between her apartments
stood wide open, giving a free circulation of air.
She sauntered through the dressing-room into the
boudoir beyond, a beautiful room looking out upon
the lake.</p>

<p>A cool, refreshing breeze gently stirred the curtains
of costly lace and kissed the fair cheek of our heroine
as she ensconced herself in an easy chair beside
the window, and, with her elbow on its arm, her chin
in her hand, gazed out over the dark waters, where
she could faintly discern the outlines of a passing
row-boat and the white sails of two or three vessels in
the offing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>A tap at the outer door, and Kathleen put in her
head, asking:</p>

<p>“Shall I light the gas for you, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ethel,” returned her young mistress, smiling.
“Not here, Katty, but in the bedroom. And turn
it quite low. The moon will be rising presently, and
I shall sit here till I see it.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll excuse me, miss, but you do look lovely
in that white dress and them pearls,” said the girl,
stepping in and turning an admiring glance upon
the graceful figure at the window. “They was just
made for the likes of you, wid your shining eyes,
your pink cheeks, and purty red lips, an’ your skin
that’s the color o’ cream an’ soft an’ fine an’ smooth
as a babby’s.”</p>

<p>Ethel shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, Katty, you have been kissing the blarney-stone,”
she said. “My cheeks are pale and my skin
dark compared with yours. And your sunny brown
tresses are far prettier, to my thinking, than my own
darker locks.”</p>

<p>“Och, Miss Ethel, an’ it’s mesilf that would
thrade aven and throw in a thrifle to boot!” replied
Kathleen, with a blush and a smile. “But it’s attendin’
to yere orders I should be, and it’s proud I’ll
be to attind to ’em if ye’ll be plazed to ring whin
I’m wanted,” she added as she courtesied and left
the room.</p>

<p>“They are certainly very beautiful,” thought
Ethel, looking down at the pearls on her wrist
gleaming out whitely in the darkening twilight,
“the dress, too, with its exquisite lace. And I&mdash;I
seem to have lost my identity with the laying off of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
my mourning!” And a tear fell, a sigh was
breathed to the memory of those for whom she had
worn it.</p>

<p>“Yet why should I grieve any longer for them,
dear as they were to me?” she thought; “for them,
the blessed dead whom I would not for worlds recall
to earth.”</p>

<p>A hush came over her spirit; she forgot herself
and her changed circumstances as she seemed to see
those beloved ones walking the golden streets, casting
their crowns at Jesus’ feet, and to hear the distant
echo of their voices singing the song of the redeemed.</p>

<p>And one day she should join them there and unite
in their song; but ah, what a long, weary road must
be travelled first! how many foes there were to be
overcome, how many dangers and temptations to be
passed through on the way!</p>

<p>The Saviour’s words, “How hardly shall they
that have riches enter into the kingdom,” came
forcibly to mind, and she trembled at thought of
her newly-acquired possessions, and lifted up her
heart to Him for strength to use them aright.</p>

<p>Then she fell to considering the duties of her new
situation, and saw very plainly that one of the first
was to devote herself to the task of making her aunt
as comfortable and happy as possible.</p>

<p>But she had been musing a long while: the moon
rode high in the heavens, the night wind had grown
cool and damp. She rose, dropped the curtain, and
withdrew to her dressing-room to prepare for her
night’s rest.</p>

<p>No life is so dark as to be utterly without blessings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
none so bright as to be wholly exempt from
trials. Ethel’s rose did not prove a thornless one.
Madame Le Conte was exacting in her affection, and
made heavy draughts upon the time and patience of
her niece.</p>

<p>The young girl soon found that her cherished
plans for the improvement of her mind must be
given up, except as she could prevail upon her aunt
to join her in the effort by listening to books worth
the reading, which was very seldom, the Madame
having no taste or appetite for solid mental food.</p>

<p>She wanted Ethel with her constantly in her waking
hours, chatting with or reading to her, and her
preference was always for the latest and most exciting
novels.</p>

<p>Ethel grieved to learn, what indeed she had suspected
all along, that her new-found relative was
utterly worldly. Madame Le Conte had not entered
a church for years; and though a very handsomely-bound
Bible lay on the table in her boudoir,
it was never opened&mdash;never till Ethel’s advent into
the household; but she was not long in persuading
her aunt to permit her to read aloud to her a few
verses every day.</p>

<p>The Madame consented to gratify her darling, but
did not always take note of what was read. Still
Ethel persevered in sowing the seed, hoping, believing
that some day it would spring up and bear fruit.</p>

<p>She succeeded also, after some weeks of persistent
effort, in coaxing the Madame to accompany her occasionally
in her attendance upon the services of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Ethel had been religiously brought up, had early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
united with the church, and though but young in
years, had attained, through the blessing of God
upon the trials of the past months, to some maturity
of Christian character; had learned in her own personal
experience how sweet it is to cast all our burdens
of sin and sorrow and care upon the Lord;
how a sense of His love can sustain in every trial,
temptation, and affliction.</p>

<p>And as day by day she perceived the restless unhappiness
of her aunt, groaning and fretting under
her physical sufferings, weighed down with remorse
on account of something in her past life, Ethel knew
not what, and sometimes full of the cares that riches
bring, especially to such as find in them their chief
treasure, she longed with an ever-increasing desire
to lead the poor lady to this divine Friend and see
her become a partaker of this blessed trust.</p>

<p>But the Madame foiled every attempt to introduce
the subject, always broaching some other topic of conversation,
or closing her eyes as if drowsy and politely
requesting her niece to be silent that she might take
a nap.</p>

<p>There were two other subjects that, for the first
few months after they came together, the Madame
avoided with more or less care&mdash;Ethel’s previous life
and her own; and perceiving her aversion, the
young girl forbore to speak of them.</p>

<p>She did not, however, forget or neglect her old
friends, but wrote to those at a distance of her
changed circumstances, and, as the Christmas holidays
again drew near, found great pleasure in preparing
a handsome present for each.</p>

<p>Hetty and her mother were remembered in like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
manner, and treated to an occasional drive in the
Madame’s fine carriage; only occasional because
they were so busy, and Ethel generally accompanied
in her drives by the Madame herself, and her maid.</p>

<p>Hetty rejoiced greatly in the improved fortunes
of our heroine, but not more than Miss Wells and
Mr. Crosby. Both of these wrote, congratulating
her heartily, and the latter added that he had vastly
enjoyed communicating the tidings to Mr. Alden,
and seeing him almost ready to tear his hair with
vexation that he had been the means of keeping
such an heiress, or perhaps rather such a fortune,
out of his family, for Espy had gone and left no
clue to his whereabouts.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Alden was so chagrined, so deeply repentant,
so anxious to repair the mischief he had done, that
at length he wrote to Ethel himself, apologizing,
begging her to forgive and forget, assuring her that
his opposition to her union with Espy was entirely
withdrawn&mdash;nay, more, that he was extremely desirous
that it should take place, and entreating her
to be kind to the lad should she ever meet or hear
from him again.</p>

<p>Ethel was with her aunt in the boudoir of the
latter when this letter was handed to her.</p>

<p>The weather was very cold, and a three days’ storm
had kept them within doors till the Madame had
grown unusually dull and spiritless, weary of every
amusement within her reach, and ready to snatch at
anything that held out the least hope of relief from
her consuming <i>ennui</i>. “Ah, a letter!” she said,
with a yawn. “Pansy, you are fortunate! no one
writes to me.”</p>

<p>“Because you write to no one, is it not, auntie?”
the girl asked playfully. “But will you excuse me
if I open and read it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, little one; who knows but you may
find something entertaining? Ah, what is it? may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
I hear?” as she saw the girl’s cheek flush and her
eye brighten, though her lip curled with a half-smile
of contempt.</p>

<p>Ethel read the letter aloud.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte was all interest and attention.</p>

<p>“What! a lover, my little Pansy!” she cried,
“and you never to tell me of him! Fie! did you
think I had grown too old to feel sympathy in affairs
of the heart?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Aunt Nannette! but&mdash;you have troubles
enough of your own, and I did not think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, tell me now; a story, and above all a
love-story&mdash;especially of your love&mdash;will be the
very thing to while away these weary hours. And
who knows but I may have the happiness of being
able to help these poor divided lovers?” she added,
touching Ethel’s cheek caressingly with the fingers
of her left hand, as she had a habit of doing.</p>

<p>“Ah, have you not helped us already?” said the
young girl, smiling through gathering tears; “for
I think he will come back some day and be glad to
learn that there is no longer anything to keep us
apart.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure of it. And now for the story.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it if you wish, aunt,” said Ethel
earnestly, a slight tremulousness and a sound of
tears in her voice; “but to give you the whole I
must also tell the story of my childhood’s days.”</p>

<p>“Let me hear it, child! let me have the whole!” the
Madame answered almost impatiently; and Ethel at
once complied.</p>

<p>She began with the first meeting between Espy and
herself when they were mere babies; drew a lovely
picture of her life in infancy and early youth; described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the terrible scenes connected with the death of
her adopted parents and the circumstances that followed,
including her formal betrothal, the search for
the missing papers, the quarrels and estrangements,
her visit to Clearfield, interview with Mrs. Dobbs,
arrival in Chicago, the conversation in Miss Lea’s
boudoir, the sight of Espy in the church the next
Sunday, her interview with him in Mr. Lea’s library;
and, lastly, the manner in which she had
learned the fact of his sudden departure from the
city the very day that she first entered the Madame’s
house, coming there in pursuit of her calling as a
dressmaker’s apprentice.</p>

<p>It was a long story, but the Madame’s interest
never flagged.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said, drawing a long breath at its
conclusion, and feeling for her niece’s hand that she
might press it affectionately, for it was growing dark
in the room, “my poor child, what you have
suffered! How did you endure it all? how did you
have courage to give up the property and go to work
for your living?”</p>

<p>“It was God who helped me,” said Ethel low and
reverently, “else I should have sunk under the
repeated blows that took all my earthly treasures
from me. But He was left me; the joy of the
Lord was my strength; and, dear aunt, there is no
other strength like that.”</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte sighed. “I wish I was as good
as you are, my little Pansy,” she said, stroking the
young girl’s hair caressingly. “But I intend to
get religion before I die. I shall need it when it
comes to that,” she added, with a shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>“I need it to live by,” remarked Ethel very gently.</p>

    <div class="p_line_i2">Our peace-branch from above!’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“But, dear aunt, don’t tell me I am good; I am
not, and my only hope is in trusting solely in God’s
offered pardon through the atoning blood and imputed
righteousness of Christ.”</p>

<p>“You never harmed anybody, Pansy, and so I’m
sure you are safe enough.”</p>

<p>“That would not save me, aunt. ‘Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into
the kingdom of heaven,’ Jesus said, and His own is
the only righteousness that does that.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve suffered so much!” the Madame went
on maunderingly, “and I too&mdash;enough, I hope, to
atone for all the evil I have done. Yes,” moving the
artificial hand slightly and bending upon it a look of
aversion and pain, while her voice sank almost to a
whisper, “I am sure my little Pansy would say so,
cruel though it was.”</p>

<p>“What was?” The words burst half unconsciously
from Ethel’s lips.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte turned a startled look upon
her.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, not to-night!” she said hurriedly.
“To-morrow, perhaps. Yes, yes, you have confided
in me, and I will not be less generous toward
you. You shall hear all; and if you hate and despise
me, I must even bear it as best I may.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Ethel had never betrayed the slightest curiosity
in regard to her aunt’s crippled condition, not only
refraining from asking questions, but with delicate
tact seeming utterly unconscious of it; but the
Madame’s words to-night, and the slight accompanying
gesture, so plainly indicating that the loss of her
hand was in some way connected with that past which
so filled her with remorse, kindled in the young girl’s
breast a strong desire to learn the whole truth; and
since her aunt had voluntarily promised to tell her
all, she did not feel called upon to repress the wish.</p>

<p>Mary’s entrance with a light, and the announcement
that tea was ready, prevented a reply to the
remark with which the Madame supplemented her
promise, and the subject was not broached again
during the hour or two that they remained together
after the conclusion of the meal.</p>

<p>But having withdrawn to the privacy of her own
apartments, Ethel sat long over the fire in her boudoir
lost in thought, vainly trying to conjecture
what cruelty her aunt could have been guilty of
toward the sister she seemed to remember with such
tender affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hate her!” she exclaimed half aloud, thinking
of the Madame’s sadly-spoken words. “No, no, I
could not do that, whatever she has done! I should
be an ingrate if I could,” she added, sending a
sweeping glance about the elegantly-appointed
room, and as she did so catching the reflection in an
opposite mirror of a slight, graceful, girlish figure
richly and tastefully attired, reclining at ease on the
most comfortable of softly-cushioned chairs in front
of a glowing, beautiful fire.</p>

<p>Without the storm was raging with increased violence;
it seemed to have culminated in a furious
tempest.</p>

<p>Absorbed in her own musings, Ethel had hardly
been conscious of it before; but now the howling of
the wind, the dashing of the waves on the shore, and
the rattling of the sleet against the windows made
her shiver and sigh as she thought of the homeless
on land and the sailors on the water alike exposed
to this wild war of the elements.</p>

<p>Ah, were Espy and her dear unknown mother
among the number? What a throb of fear and pain
came with that thought!</p>

<p>But she put it resolutely aside. She would hope
for the best, and&mdash;there was One who knew where
each of these loved ones was, and who was able to
take care of them. To His kind keeping she would
commit both them and herself, and go to her rest
with the peaceful, confiding trust of a little child.</p>

<p>“Ah, little one, how did you rest?” was Madame
Le Conte’s morning salutation.</p>

<p>“Delightfully, auntie; dropped asleep the instant
my head touched the pillow, and knew no more till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
woke to find the sun shining in at the windows.
And you? how did you rest?”</p>

<p>“Very little,” the Madame sighed, shaking her
head sadly; “my asthma was worse than usual,
and would scarcely allow me to lie down.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry! But you are better?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the attack has passed.”</p>

<p>The tempest was over, the day still, calm, and
bright, but intensely cold, and the streets were so
blocked up by a heavy fall of snow that going out
was not to be thought of; nor were they likely to be
troubled with callers.</p>

<p>“We shall have the day to ourselves,” the Madame
remarked as they left the breakfast-table, “and
if you will invite me into your boudoir, Pansy, we
will pass the morning there for variety.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to entertain and wait upon
you, Aunt Nannette,” Ethel answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>She was looking very lovely in a pretty morning
dress of crimson cashmere, edged at neck and sleeves
with ruches of soft, rich lace.</p>

<p>Having seen her aunt comfortably established in
an easy chair, Ethel took possession of a low rocker
near her side, and employing her busy fingers with
some fancy work&mdash;a shawl of soft white zephyr
which she was crocheting for Hetty&mdash;waited with outward
composure, but inward impatience, for the fulfilment
of yesterday’s promise.</p>

<p>The Madame sat with her hands folded in her
lap, her eyes gazing into vacancy, her breathing
somewhat labored, her thoughts evidently far away.
To Ethel’s eager expectance it seemed a long time
that she sat thus, but at length she began, in a low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
even tone, much as if she were reading aloud, and
with eyes still looking straight before her:</p>

<p>“I was eight years older than my sister Ethel, my
little Pansy. There had been others, but they all
died in infancy, and we two were the only ones
left when our parents were taken. That was when
Ethel was fourteen and I twenty-two.</p>

<p>“I tried to be a mother to her. I was very fond
of her, yet now I can see that I always cared more
for my own happiness than for hers&mdash;always wanted
to be first, and to rule her.</p>

<p>“We lived in Jefferson, Indiana, a mere village, to
which the family had removed shortly before the
death of our father; he and mother went very
near together, both dying of congestive chills. We
were left with a little home of our own and a modest
competence, and we continued to keep house, a
middle-aged woman who had been in the family
from the time of my birth matronizing us and
taking the oversight of domestic affairs.”</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte paused for breath, and Ethel
said softly, “Aunt, you have never told me the family
name; it seems odd enough that I should never
have heard it&mdash;my own mother’s maiden name.”</p>

<p>“Gramont&mdash;Nannette and Ethel Gramont we
were called, and I have always thought them very
pretty names.”</p>

<p>Again the Madame paused for a moment. Her
voice trembled slightly as she resumed:</p>

<p>“It was something more than a year after we
were left alone in the world that Rolfe Heywood
came to Jefferson and opened a dry-goods store.
He was a fine-looking, gentlemanly fellow, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
twenty three or four years old, I should think, well
educated, of agreeable manners, and rather fond of
ladies’ society.</p>

<p>“I was pleased with him, and the liking seemed
to be mutual. He became a frequent visitor at our
house, and soon the girls began to tease me about
him. He was said to be paying attention to me, and
indeed I think he was at first, and I gave him
some little encouragement&mdash;not much, for I had
several suitors, and was naturally inclined to coquetry;
but I liked Rolfe Heywood best of all. I
think partly because I was less sure of him than of
the others, and that piqued my vanity and pride.</p>

<p>“He did not offer himself, but kept on coming to
the house and making himself very much at home
there. And so things went on for nearly two years,
when all at once I discovered that it was Ethel he
admired and wanted. She was seventeen now, and
a sweeter, prettier creature you never saw. Ah, my
darling little Pansy!”</p>

<p>Tears rolled down the Madame’s cheeks. She
hastily wiped them away.</p>

<p>“How did you make the discovery, aunt?” her
niece asked in low but eager tones.</p>

<p>“By a look I saw him give her, and which she did
not see. It made me furious at him, and I vowed
he should never have her. I thought she did not
care for him. I kept her out of his way as much as
I could, and she made no resistance. But the more
obstacles I threw in his way the more eager after
her he became.</p>

<p>“At length we learned that he had sold out his
business and was going to California, and now my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
eyes were opened to the fact that Pansy did care for
him, she turned so white when she heard the news.</p>

<p>“But I said to myself that it was only a passing
fancy, and she would soon forget him. I watched
her constantly, and contrived never to allow them to
be alone together.</p>

<p>“But one day&mdash;the day he was to leave&mdash;he called,
and found her alone in the parlor. He had not been
there ten minutes, though, before I hurried in, pretending
to think his call was meant as much for me
as for her, and was just in time to prevent a declaration
of love which I saw he was beginning.</p>

<p>“It was his last opportunity, and he went away
without telling her his feelings or learning hers. He
held her hand lingeringly in parting, but I gave him
no chance to speak.</p>

<p>“Poor thing! she drooped sadly when he was
gone, but I took no notice, saying to myself,
‘She’ll get over it in time.’</p>

<p>“I thought he would write, and he did. I took his
letter from the office, deliberately broke the seal,
read it (’twas full of passionate love, and would
have been a cordial to the poor darling’s fainting
heart), and answered with a cold rejection of his suit,
imitating my sister’s hand so perfectly that even she
could hardly have recognized it as a counterfeit, and
signing her name.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Le Conte was paying me attention at
this time, having come to the place some months before.
He was a handsome, middle-aged man, of
courtly manners and considerable wealth. I found
his company agreeable, and before we had been acquainted
a year we were married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>“He had an intimate friend, a distant relative,
Adrian Farnese, who came to see us shortly after our
marriage, and who took a violent fancy to Ethel from
the first moment he set eyes on her.</p>

<p>“He courted her assiduously, but she turned
coldly from him and rejected his addresses again
and again, much to my husband’s annoyance and
mine, for we both liked Adrian and desired the
match.</p>

<p>“I undertook to reason with Ethel, saying everything
I could think of in Adrian’s favor. She heard
me in sad silence, and when at last I insisted upon
her giving me a reason for her persistent rejection,
she burst into tears, crying out, ‘Oh, how can I
marry him when my heart is another’s?’</p>

<p>“Then I twitted her with giving her heart unasked,
said I knew it was to Rolfe Heywood she
had lost it, but he didn’t care for her now, if he ever
had; that was plain enough from his silence. No
doubt he had found a new sweetheart by this time&mdash;perhaps
was already married.</p>

<p>“My poor little Pansy never answered back a
word, but cried as if her heart would break.”</p>

<p>The Madame’s voice broke. She stopped, buried
her face in her handkerchief, and sobbed aloud.
Tears were stealing down the cheeks of her listener
also, and for a moment neither spoke.</p>

<p>Then the Madame resumed her narrative:</p>

<p>“As I said before, Ethel and I were very different&mdash;she
so gentle and yielding, so ready to think
others wiser than herself; I proud and wilful,
always made more determined by opposition. I
resolved that she should marry Adrian Farnese.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, how could you be so cruel?” cried her listener.</p>

<p>“Ah, try not to hate me! I have suffered terribly
for my fault, as you shall learn presently,” said the
Madame in piteous tones. “But how shall I tell of
all my wicked unkindness to that poor child! I
wrote a notice of the marriage of Rolfe Heywood,
giving a fictitious name to the bride, and sent it to a
paper published in New York. I was a subscriber,
and when the number with the notice came I showed
it to Ethel, saying, ‘You see I was right. Rolfe Heywood
cared nothing for you, and is already united to
another.’”</p>

<p>“She turned deathly white, seemed about to faint,
but recovering herself a little, hastily left the room.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ I thought, ‘she will presently give up
and marry Adrian.’ But she would not hear of it,
and avoided him whenever she could without absolute
rudeness.</p>

<p>“‘No, she’ll never give up while she knows Rolfe
Heywood is alive,’ I said to my husband one day.</p>

<p>“‘Then we must make her believe him dead,’ he
answered.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to publish a false report of his
death, but we got one printed on a slip of paper that
had the appearance of having been cut from a newspaper,
and I gave it to my sister. She swooned, and
looked so deathlike, seemed so utterly crushed for
days and weeks afterward, that I could scarcely refrain
from telling her the whole truth. But the fear
of my husband’s displeasure, and the thought that if
I did Rolfe Heywood would get her after all, restrained
me. So I kept my secret, and tried to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
all other amends in my power by being very kind
and sympathizing.</p>

<p>“Ah, her gratitude for it was quite touching&mdash;almost
harder to withstand than her grief!</p>

<p>“She seemed gradually to recover from the shock,
but was never again the light-hearted, merry creature
she had been before Rolfe Heywood went away.”</p>

<p>“And she learned at last to love&mdash;?” Ethel broke
off without pronouncing the name.</p>

<p>“She finally gave up to us and married him,”
sighed the Madame. “How much she loved him, if
at all, I do not know. I tried to believe her not unhappy,
and she made no complaint.</p>

<p>“However, they had not been married many
months when a fierce quarrel arose between our husbands.
It was about some money matters. I never
fully understood it, but I then learned for the first
time that it was more Pansy’s little fortune Adrian
wanted than herself, and that Monsieur Le Conte’s
influence was used in his favor because they had
agreed that in that way he should cancel a debt owed
to Adrian. Had I known this I would never have let
them use me as their tool.”</p>

<p>“And he was my father!” murmured Ethel in a
pained tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, child, and you might justly hate me for giving
you such a one!” exclaimed the Madame
almost passionately. “I’m afraid he was a bad
man. I fear he was unkind to my sister; but she
was loyal to him, poor thing.</p>

<p>“When the quarrel arose between him and Monsieur
Le Conte I sided with my husband, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to Ethel with his version of the affair; but she would
not listen to me.</p>

<p>“‘I am his wife now,’ she said; ‘I will hear nothing
against him. And you, Nannette, who brought
about the match, should be the last to tempt me to
do so.’</p>

<p>“I was very angry, and heaped bitter reproaches
upon her,” pursued the Madame, almost overcome
by emotion. “She heard them in grieved silence,
which somehow only exasperated me the more, and
I said still harder and more cruel words. And so I
left her.”</p>

<p>For some minutes the room was filled with the
sound of the Madame’s sobs, and Ethel wept with
her.</p>

<p>“It was our last interview,” she began again in a
broken voice. “A few days later her husband spirited
her away no one knew whither, and from that
day to this I have never heard a word from her or
about her, except what I have learned through you&mdash;her
child.</p>

<p>“I have now told you of my crime; I have yet to
tell of its punishment. In spite of all my unkindness, I
loved my sister; how dearly I never guessed till she
was gone. I was nearly frantic at her loss, and at
the thought of my last words to her.</p>

<p>“The world went prosperously with us so far as
money was concerned. My husband invested my
little fortune and his own partly in an oil-well, partly
in a gold-mine in California, and we were wonderfully
successful in both. But we were not happy.
Remorse and anxiety about Pansy made me wretched
and robbed me of my vivacity and my bloom. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
grew dull and spiritless, and my husband began to
neglect me and to seek the society of other women,
whom, as he said, he found more entertaining.</p>

<p>“I sought forgetfulness in dress and all sorts of
dissipation. I could not bear to be alone; but
sometimes Monsieur Le Conte’s business would call
him away for days and weeks together. I had no
child, and I could not always go out or contrive to
have company in the house; and so at times I would
try to drown my misery in the wine-cup.</p>

<p>“I did not become a drunkard, but two or three
times I drank to intoxication.”</p>

<p>She paused, and, with a downward glance at her
mutilated limb, sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“One wild, stormy night I was quite alone,” she
continued. “The wind howled round the house like
a legion of devils, as it seemed to me, and the air was
full of eerie sounds. I had been more than usually
depressed all day, and grew worse and worse as the
hours crept slowly by. My husband I knew would
not be home before morning; one servant was away,
and the other had gone to bed in a distant part of
the house.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t exactly afraid, but I kept thinking of
Ethel, and how I had ill-used her, and that I should
probably never see her again, till I was half crazed
with remorse. At last I could not endure it any
longer. I kept wine in a closet in my dressing-room;
I went to it, poured out and drank one glass
after another till I was quite stupefied.</p>

<p>“The last thing I remember is dropping into a
chair beside the fire&mdash;a low-down grate filled with
glowing coals; the next I knew I awoke in my bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
roused to consciousness by a sharp pain in my right
arm.</p>

<p>“My husband, the servant-woman&mdash;who was crying
bitterly&mdash;and two or three doctors were in the
room. They were talking in low tones, and kept
glancing at me.</p>

<p>“‘What is the matter?’ I asked; ‘what have you
been doing to my hand that it pains me so?’ It
was the surgeon nearest me who answered.</p>

<p>“‘Madame,’ he said in a compassionate tone, ‘it
was so badly burned that we were obliged to take it
off.’</p>

<p>“‘Off! burned!’ I shrieked, wild with terror and
despair.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he said, ‘your husband found you lying
insensible on the floor, with your right hand in the
grate and burnt almost to a cinder.’”</p>

<p>Ethel sprang up, threw her arms about the Madame’s
neck, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>“My poor, poor aunt!” she said when she could
speak. “What a dreadful, dreadful thing it was!
My heart aches for you! oh, how could you bear
it?”</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte returned the caress, then Ethel
resumed her seat.</p>

<p>“I could not escape it!” she sighed, “and I felt
that it was a just punishment that deprived me of
the hand I had used to forge the notices which
robbed my sister of her lover.</p>

<p>“Remorse has tortured me horribly many a time
since, but I never have resorted to the intoxicating
cup to escape its stings.</p>

<p>“I gave up society from the time of my accident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
I could not bear the thought of exposing myself to
the curious gaze and questioning of common acquaintances
or of strangers.</p>

<p>“My husband pitied me very much, and never once
said to me, ‘It is your own fault,’ as well he might.
Finding how I shrank from meeting any one I knew,
he proposed removing to this city, where we were entirely
unknown, and I was glad to come. It is now
ten years since he died, leaving me everything he
possessed.”</p>

<p>“And all alone!” sighed Ethel, breaking the momentary
pause that followed the concluding sentence
of the Madame’s story. “Ten years of utter loneliness,
save the presence of hired servants&mdash;of constant
ill-health and mental anguish, besides the
dreadful loss of your right hand! My poor, poor
aunt, you have indeed suffered horribly and long!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, and I hope Heaven will accept it
as some atonement! Well, what is it, child: you
deem it not sufficient?” as Ethel turned upon her a
pained, troubled look.</p>

<p>“Ah, Aunt Nannette,” she said, “there is but one
atonement for sin, even the blood of Christ.”</p>

<p>“My sister, my gentle, forgiving little Pansy,
would think I had endured far more than enough,”
sobbed the Madame in an injured tone, and almost
turning her back upon her niece.</p>

<p>Ethel dropped her crocheting, rose hastily, and
putting her arms about the Madame’s neck, said
soothingly, “Don’t misunderstand me, auntie dear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
I did not mean&mdash;I could not feel for a moment that
my mother or I could wish to add a feather’s weight
to all you have suffered, or help grieving over it, or
wishing you might have been spared it.”</p>

<p>“What then?” asked the Madame petulantly, and
with a movement as if she would free herself from
the enfolding arms.</p>

<p>“Only,” Ethel said gently, withdrawing them
and resuming her seat, “that sin as committed
against God cannot be atoned for by anything that
we can do or suffer.”</p>

<p>“I shall try to sleep now,” said the Madame, closing
her eyes. “I am exhausted.”</p>

<p>And truly she looked as if she were; her face
was haggard and old beyond her years, and her eyes
were swollen with weeping.</p>

<p>Ethel’s filled with tears as she gazed upon the
careworn, miserable face, and thought how wretched
she was in spite of all her wealth; how her wounded
spirit would keep her so, even could her hand and
health of body be restored.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” said the young girl to herself,
“none but Jesus can do her good, and she will not
come to Him.”</p>

<p>Feigned sleep presently became real, and for an
hour or more Ethel was to all intents and purposes
as much alone as if she had been sole occupant of
the room.</p>

<p>She did not move from her chair, but her fingers
were busy with her crocheting, her thoughts equally
so with the tale to which she had been listening.</p>

<p>It seemed to have made her acquainted with her
mother, and she dwelt upon her character, as drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
by Madame Le Conte, with ever-increasing love and
admiration.</p>

<p>How she pitied her sorrows&mdash;the separation from
him who had won her young, guileless heart, the
news that he was lost to her, then of his death! Ah
how could <em>she</em> bear such tidings of Espy! He would
never love another; but he might die. She shivered
and turned pale at the very thought. Ah, God
grant she might be spared that heart-breaking grief!
But should it come, she would live single all her
days; she could never be forced or persuaded to do
as her mother had done; her nature was less gentle
and yielding, better fitted to brave the storms of
life. That loveless marriage! ah, how sad! how
dreadful the trials that followed!</p>

<p>And her mother had married again. Rolfe Heywood
was not really dead, and perhaps&mdash;ah yes, it
must have been he who had found and won her, he
the one whom she had always loved; Ethel was certain
of it, certain that none but he could have reconciled
her, the bereaved, heart-broken mother, to life,
and so quickly gained her for his bride.</p>

<p>And had she forgotten her child in her new-found
happiness? the child who was now searching so
eagerly, lovingly for her? No, no, the tender
mother-love could not be so easily quenched! No
doubt unavailing efforts had been made to recover
her lost treasure; and though other little ones had
perhaps come to share that love, the first-born held
her own place in the mother’s heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, when shall I find her? how can I endure this
waiting, waiting in suspense? ’Tis the hardest
thing in life to bear!” she exclaimed half aloud, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
that she was not alone; letting her work
fall in her lap while she clasped her hands together
over her beating heart and drew a long, sighing
breath.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what is it?” cried Madame Le Conte,
starting from her sleep and rubbing her eyes. “Has
anything happened?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing. How thoughtless I have been to
disturb your slumbers!” Ethel said, rising, bending
over her, and gently stroking her hair.</p>

<p>“Oh,” sighed the Madame, “it is no matter! my
dreams were not pleasant: I am not sorry to have
been roused from them. But what is it that you
find so hard to bear?”</p>

<p>“This suspense&mdash;this doubt whether my mother
still lives; whether I shall ever find her.”</p>

<p>“We will! we must!” cried the Madame with
energy, starting up in her chair as she spoke.
“They say money can do everything, and I will
pour it out like water!”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Ethel low and tremulously, “will
pray, <em>pray</em> that, if the will of God be so, we may be
speedily brought together; and prayer moves the
Arm that moves the universe.”</p>

<p>“And we will share the waiting and suspense together;
it will be easier than for either alone. But
if you have found it hard to endure for one year,
what do you suppose the ten that I have waited and
watched have been to me?”</p>

<p>Many, many times in the next two years, while
looking, longing, hoping even against hope for the
finding of her mother and the coming of Espy,
Ethel’s heart repeated that cry, “Oh, this weary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
weary waiting, this torturing suspense! it is hard,
hard to bear!”</p>

<p>Two years, and no word of or from either. Two
years of freedom from poverty with all its attendant
ills. Two years of abounding wealth.</p>

<p>But poverty is not the greatest of evils, nor do
riches always bring happiness. Ethel’s life during
this time had had other trials besides the absence of
those loved ones, and the uncertainty in regard to
their well-being and their return to her.</p>

<p>Her days, and often her nights also, were spent in
attendance upon her aunt, whose ailments seemed
to increase, and who grew more and more querulous,
unreasonable, and exacting.</p>

<p>Ethel bore it all very patiently, seldom appearing
other than cheerful and content in her aunt’s presence,
though sometimes giving way to sadness and
letting fall a few tears in the privacy of her own
apartments.</p>

<p>There was a sad, aching void in the poor hungry
heart which the Madame’s capricious, selfish affection
could not fill. A hunger of the mind, too, for other
and better intellectual food than the novels she was
daily called upon to read aloud for the Madame’s
delectation.</p>

<p>But, as says an old writer, “Young trees root all
the faster for shaking,” and the young girl’s character
deepened and strengthened under the trying but
salutary discipline.</p>

<p>She was developing into a noble, well-poised woman,
soft in manner, energetic in action, unworldly
and unselfish to a remarkable degree. And making
diligent use of the scraps of time she could secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
to herself, she was accomplishing far more than she
realized in the direction of mental culture.</p>

<p>On a bright, warm day in the latter part of April,
1876, Ethel sat in her boudoir looking over the morning
paper. As usual, the advertisements claimed her
first attention; for who could say that Espy and her
mother might not be searching for her in the same way
in which she was pursuing her quest for the latter?</p>

<p>Ah, nothing there for her. The daily recurring disappointment
drew forth a slight sigh. An additional
shade of sadness rested for an instant upon the fair
face, then was replaced by a most sweet expression
of patient resignation.</p>

<p>The paper was full of the coming Centennial. She
read with interest the descriptions of the great buildings
and the many curious and beautiful things already
pouring into them; also of the preparations
for the accommodation of the crowds of people from
all parts of the world who were expected to flock
thither.</p>

<p>A thought struck her, and her face lighted up;
her heart beat fast. She started to her feet, the
paper still in her hand; then dropping into her chair
again, turned once more to the advertisements and
marked one with her pencil, after which she sat for
some moments in deep thought.</p>

<p>A tap at the door, and Mary, putting in her head,
said, “The Madame wants you to come now, miss.”</p>

<p>Ethel hastened to obey the summons.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte was in her boudoir, receiving a
professional call from her physician, Dr. Bland.</p>

<p>The doctor rose with a smile as the young girl entered,
and offered his hand in cordial greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed to bring with her a breath of the sweet
spring air, so fresh and fair was she in her dainty
morning dress of soft white cashmere, relieved by a
bunch of violets at the throat, and another nestling
amid the dark glossy braids of her hair.</p>

<p>The easy grace of her movements, the brightness
of her eyes, the delicate bloom on the softly-rounded
cheek and chin, spoke of perfect health.</p>

<p>“You are quite well?” he asked, handing her a
chair.</p>

<p>“Quite, I am thankful to say. No hope of finding
another patient in me, doctor,” she returned laughingly.
“But what of Aunt Nannette?”</p>

<p>“I think she needs a change of air and scene. I
have been trying to persuade her to go to Europe for
the summer; or if she would stay a year, it would be
better.”</p>

<p>“Preposterous idea!” wheezed the patient.
“Hardly able to ride down town, how could I think
of undertaking to cross the ocean? Suppose there
should be a shipwreck; immensely heavy, unwieldy,
helpless as I am, I’d go to the bottom like a lump
of lead. No, no, home’s the only place for me.”</p>

<p>“You will get no better here, Madame,” said the
doctor shortly.</p>

<p>“And we need not anticipate a shipwreck,” said
Ethel. “The sea air might do you great good.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s nonsense to talk of it!” returned
the Madame impatiently.</p>

<p>The doctor rose and bowed himself out. Ethel
ran after him, stopped him in the hall, and talked
eagerly for a few moments.</p>

<p>“By all means, if you can persuade her; anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
for a change,” he answered, bidding the young girl
a smiling adieu.</p>

<p>She stood musing a moment when he had left her;
then rousing herself, hastened back to her aunt, who
said reproachfully:</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t run away and leave me
alone, Ethel. I want to be read to.”</p>

<p>“And I am entirely at your service,” the young
girl returned pleasantly, taking up the morning paper
again and seating herself near the Madame’s
easy chair. “There are some articles here about the
Centennial which I am sure will interest you.”</p>

<p>She read with an enthusiasm that was contagious.</p>

<p>“What a pity we should miss it all!” exclaimed
the Madame at length. “There will never be another
Centennial of our country in my lifetime, or
even in yours.”</p>

<p>“No; and why should we not go, as well as
others?” Ethel answered with suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>“Impossible, in my invalid condition.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Nannette,” cried Ethel, throwing down
the paper and clasping her hands together in her excitement,
“people will be flocking there from all
parts of the land and the civilized world. I have a
presentiment that my mother will be there, and that
we shall meet her if we go!”</p>

<p>“Child, child! do you really think it?” cried the
Madame, starting up, then sinking back again upon
her cushions panting and trembling.</p>

<p>“I do, Aunt Nannette, I do indeed! and we shall
never, never have such another opportunity. And
Espy, too, will be there&mdash;I know it, I feel it! He is
an artist. Will he not have a picture to exhibit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see it! we must go! But how can I?
how can we manage it? I can never live in a hotel,
never exist in a crowd; I should suffocate!” And
the Madame wheezed and panted and wiped the perspiration
from her face, while her huge frame trembled
like a jelly, so great was her agitation.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, Aunt Nannette,” said Ethel,
dropping on her knees and taking the shaking hands
in hers, while she lifted to the Madame’s troubled,
distressed face her own&mdash;sparkling, animated, fairly
radiant with hope and gladness. “I have already
planned it all, and Dr. Bland approves. There are
furnished houses to let. We will write and engage
one for the whole season&mdash;six or eight months&mdash;and
we will take our servants with us and go directly
there, leaving this house in the care of a trusty middle-aged
couple I know. We will have our own carriage
and horses, and drive about the beautiful park
to our hearts’ content. We will go now, while there
is no crowd, and, having plenty of time, can see
everything we care to look at without fatiguing ourselves
by attempting too much at once.”</p>

<p>“How rapid you are! Really, child, you almost
take my breath away!” panted the Madame, shaking
her head dubiously, though evidently attracted
by the bright picture Ethel had drawn.</p>

<p>“But you will go? I may make the arrangements?
Oh, think what it would be to find your
long-lost sister!” said Ethel, pressing the hands she
held, and gazing with pleading eyes into the Madame’s
face.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! but ah, the journey? how am I to accomplish
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel reassured her on that point, overruled one or
two other objections which she raised, and, not giving
her time to retract her permission, hastened to
her writing-desk and wrote a note to Mr. Tredick,
asking him to call that day or the next, and an answer
to an advertisement of a furnished house to let
in West Philadelphia, which, from the description,
she felt nearly certain would suit them, engaging the
first refusal, promising to be on the spot within a
week, and to take immediate possession should
everything prove to be as represented.</p>

<p>Both notes were despatched as soon as written, a
message sent to the persons in whose care Ethel proposed
to leave their present residence, and then she
returned to her aunt.</p>

<p>“And now Mary and I will overhaul the trunks
and decide, with your help, auntie, what is to be
taken with us and what left behind.”</p>

<p>“Child, child,” cried the Madame breathlessly,
“how precipitate you are! Engaged to be in Philadelphia
in a week! How are we to prepare in that
short space of time?”</p>

<p>“No great amount of preparation needed, auntie
dear,” laughed Ethel, throwing her arms about the
Madame’s neck.</p>

<p>“Shopping, Pansy, dressmaking&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, we have loads of dresses already!” interrupted
the girl in her most persuasive tones. “And
think of the hundreds of stores and dressmakers and
milliners in Philadelphia! Can’t we get everything
we want there? Don’t let us carry too many coals
to Newcastle,” she ended, with a silvery laugh that
brought a smile to her aunt’s face in spite of herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Le Conte’s inertia was compelled to give
way before Ethel’s energetic persistence, and the girl
carried her point. In a week they were cosily established
in a very pleasant residence within easy walking
distance of the great Centennial grounds.</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte had found the journey very
fatiguing. For a few days she utterly refused to stir
out of the house, indeed kept her room almost constantly,
and would scarcely allow Ethel to go out
of her sight.</p>

<p>This was hard on the young girl, for she was burning
with impatience to be looking, not upon the rare
and beautiful things brought together in the Exposition
from all quarters of the earth, but for the
loved one of whom she had been in quest for years.
Was she there? should she see her? would they recognize
each other? Ah, it seemed to her that until
that dear one was found she should have no eyes for
anything but the multitude of faces presented to her
gaze. How could she wait? how endure the slow
torture of passing hour after hour, and day after day,
shut up with her invalid aunt, listening to her endless
fretting and complaining, her reproaches for having
brought her away from the home where she was so
comfortable, the physician who so thoroughly understood
her constitution, wearing her out with the
long journey with really no object but a wild-goose
chase after the unattainable; for now she was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
convinced that her sister would have been found
long since had she been in the land of the living.</p>

<p>Ethel’s patience was sorely tried; her courage
also, for it was difficult to keep hope alive in her
own breast while compelled to hear an incessant
repetition of these doleful prognostications.</p>

<p>But at last there was a rift in the cloud. Madame
Le Conte woke one morning feeling rested and refreshed
by her night’s sleep, and consequently in
tolerable spirits, and Ethel succeeded in coaxing her
into her carriage. They drove to and about the
park, visited the Main Building, and the Madame
spent a couple of hours in a rolling chair, and returned
home delighted with her day’s experience.</p>

<p>She had no more reproaches for her niece on the
score of having brought her to the great Exhibition
almost against her will, but still maintained that
there was no reasonable hope of finding her lost sister
there.</p>

<p>Yet Ethel was not to be discouraged, but began
every day with renewed hope that ere its close her
long quest should be ended.</p>

<p>“Mother, mother! and Espy, my own Espy!” her
heart kept whispering in the solitude of her own room,
and as her eye moved from face to face in the streets,
the cars, the buildings and grounds of the Exposition.</p>

<p>She wanted to be there every day, and all day, because
there, as it seemed to her, she must find them;
but her aunt could not bear the fatigue of constant
attendance, and was not willing to be left at home
till, to Ethel’s great joy, she came upon a lap-dog the
exact counterpart of the lost Frisky in appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
and with fully as great an aptitude for learning
amusing little tricks; and the entertainment Madame
Le Conte found in teaching and caressing him
was sufficient to induce her to allow her niece occasionally
to go out without her.</p>

<p>And those days when she was free from the care
imposed by her aunt’s companionship, and at liberty
to roam about at her own sweet will, were by far the
most enjoyable to Ethel. She liked to lengthen them
out, and had often eaten her breakfast and gone long
before the Madame awoke from her morning nap,
and sometimes the sun was near his setting when she
returned.</p>

<p>She was interested in the exhibits, yet few faces of
men or women that came within her range of vision
escaped her observation. The main object of her
coming was never absent from her mind; she pursued
her search diligently, but at times physical
weariness compelled her to pause and rest awhile.</p>

<p>On a lovely day early in June, after four or five
hours spent in the usual manner, she turned aside
from the vicinity of the hurrying crowds, and seeking
out a cool, quiet retreat in a little dell by the side
of a limpid stream of water, sat down on a bench in
the shade of some weeping willows.</p>

<p>With her hands folded in her lap, her eyes upon
the rivulet that went singing and dancing almost at
her feet, she was thinking of her lost loved ones,
and weighing the chances of meeting them, when
some one sprang down the bank and pushed aside the
drooping branches which half concealed her from
view. Lifting her eyes, there was a simultaneous,
joyous exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Floy!”</p>

<p>“Espy!”</p>

<p>She hardly knew what followed&mdash;so sudden, so
great was the glad surprise&mdash;but in another moment
he was sitting by her side, her hand in his, one
arm about her waist, while in an ecstasy of delight
he gazed into her blushing, radiant face.</p>

<p>For a time their joy was beyond words; but what
need of them? Was it not enough that they were together?</p>

<p>At last Espy spoke. His tones were low and
pleading.</p>

<p>“Floy, darling, you will not send me from you
again? It is true I have not gained my father’s consent
(I have not even seen him or so much as heard
from him for over two years), but I am no longer a
child; am pushing my own way in the world, and
since this thing will affect my happiness so much
more nearly than his, and probably long after he has
gone from earth, I cannot think it is required of us
to wait for that.”</p>

<p>He paused, but the girl did not speak. Her
eyes were on the ground, a soft blush suffused her
cheek, and a slight smile trembled about her full red
lips.</p>

<p>She perceived that Espy had heard nothing of her
changed circumstances and the consequent alteration
in his father’s feelings; and, for reasons of her
own, she preferred that he should for the present
remain in ignorance of these things; yet she could
not drive him from her again, could not deny to him
or herself the happiness that now might be lawfully
theirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, she felt that his reasoning was sound; that
he was of age to choose for himself, and to disregard
his father’s refusal to give consent.</p>

<p>“Floy, Floy, you will not, cannot be so cruel as
to bid me begone?”</p>

<p>Espy’s voice was full of passionate entreaty, and
his grasp tightened upon her hand.</p>

<p>“No, no, I cannot,” she faltered; “I cannot so
reward such love and constancy as yours. When we
last met you refused to accept your freedom, and&mdash;you&mdash;shall
not have it now,” she concluded playfully,
lifting a smiling, blushing face to his for an instant,
then half averting it as she caught the look of ecstasy
in his.</p>

<p>“Your willing slave for life, I hug my chain!” he
cried in transport.</p>

<p>“Which means me, I suppose,” she laughed, for
he drew his arm more closely about her as he spoke.</p>

<p>“A golden chain,” he whispered low and rapturously;
“such fetters and warder as Fitz-James appointed
for the Graeme.”</p>

<p>Another arch smile, and another swift, bewitching
glance from the lustrous eyes, were the only reply
vouchsafed him; but he seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>“Floy, my own little wife!” he whispered, bending
over her to look into the blushing, happy face,
“this moment repays me for all the loneliness, all
the struggles of the past two years.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell of a long, weary, fruitless
search for her.</p>

<p>He had returned to Chicago shortly after his
mother’s death, hoping to learn her address from the
Leas, but found their house closed and a bill of sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
upon it. The newspapers told him of Mr. Lea’s defalcation
and subsequent suicide, but he could not
discover the whereabouts of the family, nor in any
other way obtain a clue to the residence of her whom
he was so anxiously seeking.</p>

<p>At length, abandoning its personal prosecution for
the time, but engaging a friend to continue it for
him, he went to Italy to pursue the study of his art,
determined to make fame and money as a worthy
offering to his “little love” when she should be
found.</p>

<p>“It has been my dream by day and by night,
dearest,” he said, “and has been partially realized.
I have sold some pictures at very good prices, and
am hoping much from some I have on exhibition
here. If they do for me what I hope, I shall soon be
able to make a home for you, where, God helping
me,” he added low and reverently, “I will shield
you from every evil and make your life as bright
and joyous and free from care as that of any bird.”</p>

<p>How her heart went out to him in proud, fond appreciation
as he said these words, his face, as he
bent over her and looked into hers with his soulful
eyes, all aglow with love and delight.</p>

<p>“But tell me,” he exclaimed as with sudden recollection,
“how has it fared with you during all these
long, weary months that we have been so far apart?
Well, I trust, for you are looking in far better health
than when I saw you last. But how came you here
in Philadelphia? I hoped, yet called myself a fool
for hoping, that I might find you here, for I could
not suppose you had means to come, much as you
might desire to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she said softly, “I did greatly desire to
come, and a good Providence opened the way,
Espy,” and she looked earnestly at him. “I have
found the deed of gift, learned my true name, and
discovered&mdash;no, not my mother,” as she saw the
question in his eyes, “but her sister, who is now
helping me in my search.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Floy, how glad I am! And I, too, will
help!” he exclaimed. “Helping you to find your
lost mother has always been a part of my dream, and
I have been working to that end. I have thought
that she, if living and prosperous, would come to
this great Exhibition, this Centennial of our country,
and the subjects for my pictures were chosen accordingly;
I have painted for her eye more than for any
other. But I shall not describe them,” he continued
in response to her eager, inquiring look. “They
were hung only this morning, and I will take you to
see them.”</p>

<p>She rose hastily, but he drew her back.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Floy, darling! let us stay here a little
longer. I think the crowd may lessen in the next
hour, and there is so much I want to say to you&mdash;to
ask you. What of this new-found relative&mdash;this
aunt? Are you happy with her? is she kind to you?”</p>

<p>“She is very fond of me, and I have a good home
with her,” Ethel answered, smiling brightly as she
turned her face to him. “And she will be glad, very
glad, to see you, Espy. I have told her the whole
story of our acquaintance and engagement, and she
is deeply interested for us both.”</p>

<p>He flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Ah, Floy, my little love! our skies are brightening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the course of true love begins to run smooth.
How glad I am for you!”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said gayly, “that you have
not asked me my true name? though I told you I
had found it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I want to hear it, and how and where
you found the paper; but I think you must let me
call you always by the name I have loved so dearly
since we were mere babies. I think no other can
ever sound so sweet to my ear.”</p>

<p>“I shall allow my willing slave to have his own
way in this one thing,” she returned sportively. “I
do not object to being Floy to you, though all others
call me Ethel.”</p>

<p>“Ethel!” he said, “that is a sweet name too.”</p>

<p>“Yes; allow me to introduce myself. Mr. Alden,
I am Ethel Farnese, sometimes called Pansy by my
aunt&mdash;a pet name she had formerly bestowed upon
my mother, the first Ethel Farnese.”</p>

<p>“I like that also,” he said, gazing with all a
lover’s admiration into the sparkling, animated face.
“You are rich in sweet names, as who has a better
right?”</p>

<p>“Where is your curiosity?” she queried. “You
have not even asked if I found the will.”</p>

<p>“No, to be sure! And you did?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I am quite convinced
that it never existed.”</p>

<p>“I presume you are right there. But I have found
my curiosity, and am burning with desire to hear
how you came to discover the other paper, to find
your aunt, and&mdash;and all the rest of it. You remember
that I know absolutely nothing of your history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
from the time of your leaving Cranley to this, except
the few moments that we were together in Mr. Lea’s
library.”</p>

<p>“And I,” she returned, “am burning with desire
to see those pictures, and to learn how they are to
assist me in my quest. The story is too long to be
told in an hour, Espy, with all the minute detail that
I know you would require. So you shall have it at
another time.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me see you home, and spend the
evening with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if my aunt will spare me. She’s an invalid,
and seems to value my society far beyond its real
worth.”</p>

<p>“Then her estimate must be high indeed,” he responded
in the same playful tone. “But since it is
your wish, fair lady, I will now conduct you to the
Art Gallery and show you the pictures.”</p>

<p>He led her out of the little dell up a flight of steps
in the grassy bank, and together they traversed the
winding paths and broad avenues that led to the Art
Building, walking along side by side silently, yet
only dimly conscious of the delicious summer air,
the brilliant sunlight, the gay parterres, the crowds
of people in the walks and passing up and down the
broad, white marble steps of Memorial Hall as they
ascended them.</p>

<p>For once Ethel had utterly forgotten her quest,
and did not look into a single one of the hundreds of
faces she passed. But a bright little girl, standing at
the foot of those same marble steps, and holding fast
to the hand of a young man, was more observant.</p>

<p>“What a pretty lady, Ellis!” she said, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
after Ethel’s lithe, graceful figure as it flitted by.
“And she looks like Dora. I thought it was at first,
but she has another sort of dress on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nan, it was a pretty face, and something
like Dora’s, I thought too,” returned the lad. “You
are tired, little sister, and yonder is an empty seat.
Shall we go to it?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no; see, they’re coming now.”</p>

<p>Then letting go his hand, and running to meet a
lady and gentleman who were sauntering toward
them from the direction of the Main Building,
“Papa and mamma,” she cried, “Ellis and I have
been waiting a long time. Shall we go in now to see
the pictures?”</p>

<p>“It is growing late, Nan, and tea will be ready
by the time we can get home if we start at once,”
said the father. “Your mother is much fatigued,
too&mdash;very tired indeed; so we will leave the pictures
for another time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care, if mamma’s tired,” said the
child, putting her hand into his.</p>

<p>Both parents smiled approval, and the little party
walked away together toward the place of exit from
the grounds.</p>

<p>In the mean time Espy was making way for himself
and Ethel through the crowds that filled the corridors
of Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>Reaching that portion of the building appropriated
to the works of American artists, he paused for
a moment or two before several paintings in succession,
calling her attention to the good points of each,
and giving the artist’s name; but when they came
to his own he waited silently for her to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>One glance, and she turned to him, her eyes full,
her features working with emotion.</p>

<p>“Mother!” was the one word that came low and
gaspingly from the quivering lips.</p>

<p>His face was a study, the gratified pride of the
artist mingling with the tender sympathy of the
lover.</p>

<p>He drew her arm within his, for she was trembling
like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>She allowed him to support her while she turned
again to the picture and studied it with mournful
pleasure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kemper’s face was a peculiar one, and had
changed but little during the fifteen quiet, uneventful
years of her life in Cranley. This picture of
Espy’s&mdash;painted from memory&mdash;represented her as
he had first seen her, with the little Ethel by her side
dressed as she was then, and holding her doll in her
arms. The pretty baby-face was as perfect a likeness
as the other. Memory had done him good service
here also, and, in addition, he had had the
assistance of a photograph taken about that time.</p>

<p>A second painting hung by the side of the first&mdash;a
full-length portrait of our heroine standing on the
threshold of her Cranley home, as Espy had seen
her on looking back after bidding her good-by
when leaving for college the last time before the accident
that wrought such woe to the young, light-hearted
girl whose pathway had been hitherto so
bright and sunny.</p>

<p>It was a speaking likeness of a very lovely face,
fair and winning, with the freshness of early youth
and the sweetness and vivacity lent it by a keen intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and a happy, loving heart. The figure and
attitude were the perfection of symmetry and grace.</p>

<p>It received many a lingering look of admiration
from strangers, but a single glance was all that Ethel
bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Kemper’s face chained her. For many
minutes her eyes were riveted upon it.</p>

<p>“Do not sell this; I must have it,” she said to
Espy as at last she turned sighing away.</p>

<p>“It is yours from this moment,” he said, flashing
upon her a look of ecstatic love.</p>

<p>“It must be late; see how long the shadows
are!” she remarked as they came down the marble
steps. “Ah, my aunt has sent for us! how fortunate!”
as she espied a carriage at some little distance,
Rory upon the box, driving slowly along and
looking this way and that as if in search of some
one.</p>

<p>She signalled him, and in another minute they
were bowling rapidly homeward.</p>

<p>Arrived, Espy was requested to take a seat in the
parlor while Ethel ran up to her aunt’s room.</p>

<p>The Madame was at first disposed to be cross, but
on hearing the wonderful news her mood changed.</p>

<p>“Was ever anything so fortunate!” she cried,
hugging her niece enthusiastically. “My darling
Pansy, I congratulate you with all my heart. He
shall be quite at home here and the course of true
love run smooth from this on, if I can make it do
so.”</p>

<p>Then Mary was directed to go down and show the
young gentleman to a room where he could attend
to the duties of the toilet, the Madame remarking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>“One always feels like washing and brushing after
tramping round all day in the heat and dust. And,
Pansy, you must make him understand that we consider
him just one of ourselves. The tea-table is
already set in my boudoir; another plate shall be
added, and we will all sup there together. Now run
away and make yourself fine.”</p>

<p>“Neat and ladylike, but not too fine, auntie,”
Ethel responded, bending down to her with a smiling
face, her cheeks glowing, her eyes dancing with
health and happiness. “For a reason I have, I want
him not to know or suspect how rich we are, so
please help on my innocent deception.”</p>

<p>“Very well, it is all one to me what he thinks
about that,” the Madame answered good-naturedly,
and Ethel tripped away to make the necessary
changes in her attire.</p>

<p>In common with other sensible people, she dressed
very simply and inexpensively for a day at the Centennial.
Her toilet for the evening was charmingly
becoming, and suited to Espy’s artist taste, yet but
little more elaborate or costly than the other.</p>

<p>Espy was much struck by the Madame’s appearance,
so different from that of her fair niece&mdash;her
unwieldy figure, enormous size, swarthy features,
ungainly movements, and asthmatic breathing; but
she was very gracious to him, an excellent foil to
Ethel’s beauty, and so kindly considerate as to leave
them to themselves for the evening directly tea was
over.</p>

<p>Two or three as blissful weeks as perhaps mortals
ever know passed over the heads of our lovers.
They were almost constantly together, alone in the
crowd, for they haunted the Centennial daily, and
Madame Le Conte, showing herself as considerate as
at first, either remained at home or quickly dismissed
them from attendance upon her, declaring
that she wanted Mary, and Mary only, to walk beside
her rolling chair, and help her to see the sights.</p>

<p>Espy’s pictures were much admired, spoken of
with marked favor by the critics, and he had several
good offers for them, but would not sell.</p>

<p>In this happy state of affairs, and with his Floy by
his side, he was in the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>But all things earthly must have an end, and so it
was with this season of almost unalloyed felicity to
Ethel and Espy.</p>

<p>One evening the latter, hurrying out of his hotel,
bound, as usual, for Madame Le Conte’s, nearly ran
over an elderly gentleman who was just coming in.
Scarcely looking at the stranger, he was brushing
past with a hasty apology, when he felt a hand laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
on his shoulder, while a familiar voice exclaimed,
in loud tones of unfeigned, exultant delight, “Why,
Espy! is it you? and don’t you know your own
father, boy?”</p>

<p>“Father!” he cried, stopping short and wheeling
about, half glad, half sorry at the meeting, the gladness
uppermost as his parent grasped his hand in
warm, fatherly greeting and gazed in his face with
the proud, affectionate look often in other days, ere
pride and greed of gold had come between them,
bent upon the bright, promising boy.</p>

<p>“I did not know you were in the city, sir! When
did you arrive?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday, or rather last night; slept late; spent
the rest of the day at the Exposition; just got back.
Come with me to my room. I want to talk with
you; have no end of things to say. Had your supper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I too; got it out there. I’m dreadfully tired,
but there’s an easy chair in the room; so can rest
and talk at the same time. Here, let’s go up in the
elevator. Capital thing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very,” Espy answered absently, taking a seat by
his father’s side, and thinking of Floy waiting and
watching for his coming.</p>

<p>“Well, where have you been all this time?” Mr.
Alden asked as he took possession of the chair he
had spoken of, and signed to Espy to be seated
upon another close at hand.</p>

<p>The young man answered briefly that the greater
part of the past two years had been spent by him in
Italy perfecting himself in his art; that he was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
doing well pecuniarily, and hoped soon to be doing
much better.</p>

<p>“Very good! very good indeed!” commented his
father, rubbing his hands and smiling broadly.
“Glad you’re doing so well, my boy; have always
had your welfare very much at heart. Now about
Floy Kemper&mdash;”</p>

<p>Espy flushed hotly, and half rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! wait till you hear what I have to
say!” exclaimed his father, breaking off in the middle
of his sentence. “I withdrew my opposition to
the match long ago, as you should have been informed
if I’d known where to find you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” Espy said, his countenance
clearing. “Everything seems to be coming round
right at last. I hope that in another year I shall be
in circumstances to marry.”</p>

<p>“He evidently hasn’t seen Floy yet,” thought Mr.
Alden to himself. “Wonder if he even knows where
she is? You do, eh?” he said aloud, rubbing his
hands again. “If it was my case&mdash;I shouldn’t wait
half that time.”</p>

<p>Espy’s countenance expressed surprise and inquiry.</p>

<p>“I did not expect such counsel from you, sir,” he
remarked, “and I cannot think it would be prudent
in me, or kind to Floy, to rush into matrimony before
I have proved my ability to support a wife.”</p>

<p>“Very wise and sensible if you were marrying a
poor girl,” returned his father, with an unpleasant
laugh; “but the income from a hundred thousand
might suffice, I should think, to begin upon in a
modest way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>“What&mdash;what can you mean, sir?” exclaimed
Espy, springing to his feet, his face flushing and
paling by turns.</p>

<p>“That’s the exact sum, as I’ve been credibly
informed, that Floy’s aunt has already settled upon
her, and she’s altogether likely to prove the only heir
to the half million the old lady still has in her possession.”
And Mr. Alden laughed gleefully, rubbing
his hands rapidly over each other; then stroking his
beard and glancing at his son, he perceived with astonishment
that his countenance was pale and distressed&mdash;that
he looked stunned as if by a heavy
blow.</p>

<p>“Why, Espy, what’s the matter?” he exclaimed
in extreme surprise; “thought you’d be delighted
with such good news. But perhaps you’ve lost
sight of the girl? Well, never mind; I can give
you her address and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Father, what do you take me for?” asked the
young man hoarsely, rising to his feet as he spoke.
“A fortune-hunter? I hope I may never deserve the
name! I do not call this good news. It seems to put
Floy farther away from a poor fellow like me, and it
has been the sweetest dream of my life that my toil
should supply her wants.”</p>

<p>“Crack-brained fool!” muttered his father angrily.</p>

<p>But Espy did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>“I see now,” he went on in a tone of bitter sarcasm,
“just why you have ceased to oppose my
wishes and become anxious to receive Floy into the
family. She will understand it too, and I am bitterly
ashamed. Thanks for your offer to furnish me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
with her address, but I do not care to avail myself
of it.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I perceive that it is not without reason
that poets and painters are popularly supposed to
lack common-sense in regard to the affairs of every-day
life,” sneered the older gentleman. “But
come, come, I don’t want to renew the old quarrel.
Sit down and let me tell you about your brothers
and sisters. They’ll be glad to hear that you have
turned up once more.”</p>

<p>Upon that the young man resumed his seat, and
for the next hour the talk was all of relatives and
friends in and about Cranley.</p>

<p>“Well, father,” Espy said at length, taking out
his watch, “I have an engagement, and you look as
though you needed rest; I’d better bid you good-night.
Will see you again in the morning. You’ll
be staying some time in the city, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no; that is, I’m going for a trip into New
York and Canada; leave by the early train to-morrow
morning, expect to be gone two or three weeks,
maybe more, and then return here to do the Exposition.
It’s the first real vacation I’ve given myself
since&mdash;well, before you were born, my boy, and I
mean to do the thing up brown while I’m about it.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, sir. I hope you won’t go back
to work till thoroughly tired of play,” Espy said
laughingly. “I may not wake in time to see you off
in the morning, but you’ll find me here, I think, on
your return to Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I trust so; but if I shouldn’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You shall hear from me; probably see me in
Cranley in the fall. Good-night, father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night, my son. Don’t fail to keep your
promises.” And shaking hands cordially, they separated.</p>

<p>It was late for a call at Madame Le Conte’s. Espy
said so to himself as he left the hotel, yet set off
upon that very errand, and not at all as if in haste
to accomplish it. Truth to tell, he was half reluctant
to meet Ethel, yet at the same time irresistibly
drawn toward her.</p>

<p>“And she’s rich!” he mused, sauntering slowly
along; “rich, and a great heiress, while I&mdash;ah
me!&mdash;am poor as a church-mouse. How can I urge
her to marry me? Wouldn’t it be like saying, ‘Be my
provider,’ instead of, ‘Let me provide for you’? I
am too proud for that. But why has she left me in
ignorance of her circumstances? Did she fear that I
would want to marry her for her money? She might
have known me better. Did <em>I</em> find fault with her for
resigning Mr. Kemper’s property? Did <em>I</em> want to
give her up when she was poor and friendless?”</p>

<p>He grew angry and indignant as he put these queries
to himself.</p>

<p>“Yes; she might have known me better,” he repeated.
“How could she suspect me of motives so
base and sordid? But no, no, it could not be that!
She <em>does</em> know me better, is too noble herself to think
that I could be capable of such meanness. No, she
saw that it was a delight to me to feel that my work
was to provide a home for her some day, and would
not deprive me sooner than necessary of that pleasure.
And yet why not tell me all? She ought to
have no secrets from me, her affianced husband.
And why let our marriage be delayed when there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
no need? If I had sufficient means, would I not tell
her of it at once, and beg that there might not be
another week of delay? But she, I suppose, likes to
be her own mistress, and keep her newly-acquired
property in her own hands. I, perhaps, am not
deemed fit to be trusted with the care of it.”</p>

<p>And losing sight of the fact that womanly delicacy
would forbid the course he was prescribing as
proper for Ethel, he grew angry again.</p>

<p>And so alternating between admiration and disgust
at her reticence, he arrived at Madame Le Conte’s
door and rang the bell.</p>

<p>No one answered it. He stood waiting for several
minutes, so busy with his own thoughts that this did
not strike him as strange. Then, suddenly growing
impatient, he was about to repeat his ring, when,
glancing up, he perceived that the windows were all
dark except those of the Madame’s bedroom, where
a faint light seemed to be burning.</p>

<p>“Gone to bed without waiting to see if I were
coming as usual,” he muttered, descending the
steps.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that very few lights were visible
in the neighboring houses, and consulting his watch
by the light of a street-lamp, found to his surprise
that it was near midnight.</p>

<p>He recollected, too, that Floy (she was still Floy to
him) had looked very weary when they left the Centennial
grounds together some hours before.</p>

<p>“Poor darling!” he said, “I’m a brute to blame
her!” and went on his way, impatient for the morrow
that he might seek the desired interview.</p>

<p>Ethel had sat up expecting him, till the lateness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the hour convinced her that he was not coming;
then she had retired, weary in body and a little heavy
at heart lest some evil had befallen him, yet ridiculing
and scolding herself for the folly of such fears.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>When they met the next day, something seemed to
have come between them.</p>

<p>“What was it?” Ethel vainly asked herself.
Something light as air; something so intangible
that she could not give it a name.</p>

<p>A change had come upon Espy, but when questioned
he insisted that nothing was wrong, sometimes
asking, almost testily, why she should think
there was; then, in sudden penitence for his ill-humor,
he would be more devoted than ever for a
time, but presently fall back into moody silence.</p>

<p>He was still dwelling upon the information his
father had given him, still querying as to his affianced’s
motives in concealing the facts from him,
and alternating between anger and admiration as the
one or the other seemed to him the more likely to
have influenced her.</p>

<p>“Why will she not be open with me?” he asked
himself a hundred times; “then there would be no
trouble.”</p>

<p>And she was thinking the same in regard to him.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that they were both in the
right there and that perfect openness between
married people and lovers would save a great deal of
trouble, heartache, and estrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was, these two began to reap a bountiful harvest
of each.</p>

<p>Espy slackened his attentions, absented himself
frequently, and when he returned to her side, Ethel’s
manner was constrained and cold.</p>

<p>The girl poured her griefs, anxieties, and perplexities
into no mortal ear. She would as soon have
thought of telling them to a child as to Madame Le
Conte; and so, feeling the need of a sympathizing
friend and counsellor, she took to longing and looking
for her mother more earnestly and constantly
than she had since the return of her betrothed.</p>

<p>“Other girls have their mothers to go to,” she
would sigh to herself. “Ah, that I had mine!”</p>

<p>Espy was not now always by her side, and on
those days when she found herself alone at the Exposition
she would go to Memorial Hall, and if able
to make her way through the crowd to the place
where his paintings hung, would stand and gaze,
through gathering tears, upon Mrs. Kemper’s portrait.</p>

<p>Espy came upon her there one day, approaching
her unperceived, and as he noted the sadness of her
countenance, the pallor of her cheek, and saw her
hastily brush away a tear, his heart smote him.</p>

<p>He pushed his way to her side, and putting his
lips to her ear,</p>

<p>“Floy, darling!” he whispered, “come with me;
take my arm, and let me help you out of this suffocating
atmosphere.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but suffered him to draw her
hand within his arm and lead her away.</p>

<p>Neither spoke until they were clear of the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
and had reached a shaded walk, where they might
converse without fear of being overheard.</p>

<p>Then turning resolutely to him,</p>

<p>“Espy,” she said, “I cannot bear this any longer.
What is wrong? what is it that has come between
us?”</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, coloring and looking down with
a mortified air, “what have I done that you should
ask me that, Floy? I have found no fault with you,
as indeed,” he added quickly, “I have had no reason
to do.”</p>

<p>“No, you have not found fault, but a change has
come over you,” she answered sadly, “and it would
be kinder, far kinder to be frank with me. Why
should you not be?”</p>

<p>“Because you have not been so with me,” he retorted
half angrily.</p>

<p>“I have not? Espy, you must explain; I insist
upon it.” And she looked so pained that his heart
smote him.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Floy, darling!” he exclaimed. “I am
a brute to hurt you so! But why did you leave me to
learn of your changed circumstances from others?
Did you fear that I would covet your wealth? that I
would love it instead of you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Espy! as if I could have so base a thought
in connection with you!” she cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>“But why not tell me?” he said, coloring deeply.</p>

<p>“Because I saw what delight you took in the
thought that you were winning the means to make a
home for me, and I would not deprive you of that
till I must; and because I was determined that no
one should say you sought me for my money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>He was deeply ashamed of his suspicions, and said
so frankly, begging her pardon.</p>

<p>“We will exchange forgiveness,” she whispered,
flashing a look upon him that thrilled him to his
heart’s core. “I was wrong too. Henceforth let us
have not the slightest concealment from each other.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” he said, tenderly pressing the hand
he held, and gazing with all a lover’s ardent admiration
into the dear face at his side, while his heart
bounded with hope and happiness.</p>

<p>And she?&mdash;ah, in the fulness of her content and
joy even her long-lost, long-sought mother was for
the moment forgotten.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, that’s Grey, mother! But never mind!
Come&mdash;Floy!” as a lady in front of them turned
suddenly round.</p>

<p>“Hetty! you here? and your mother too?” cried
Ethel, who had been made aware of their unexpected
vicinity by the sound of the words and voices so
familiar to her ear two years ago.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Goodenough, “we were just
looking at those splendid jewels from New York.”</p>

<p>“We have just come to the city,” said Hetty;
“arrived last night; and oh, I am so glad to have
met you! for I have something to tell you.”</p>

<p>The eager, animated look and tone said that it
was something of importance, and Ethel’s heart gave
a wild bound. Was it news that would aid her in
her quest?</p>

<p>She drew out her watch. “One o’clock: a good
hour for lunch. Come with me to Public Comfort.
You must be my guests.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you!” and they went with her.</p>

<p>“Are you here alone?” asked Mrs. Goodenough
as they crossed the avenue.</p>

<p>“I have often come alone,” returned Ethel, smiling.
“A friend was with me this morning; left me
half an hour ago, and will meet me half an hour
hence at Public Comfort.”</p>

<p>“A very particular friend,” thought Hetty to
herself, noticing the light in Ethel’s eye, the deepening
of the color on her cheek, as she mentioned him.</p>

<p>She had heard of Espy, knew something of what
had been the state of affairs between the lovers.</p>

<p>“My dear, has he come back?” she asked in a delighted
whisper.</p>

<p>Ethel’s blush and smile were sufficient to assure
her that such was the case, and her kindly, affectionate
heart was overjoyed.</p>

<p>They were so fortunate as to find an unoccupied
corner in the ladies’ parlor at Public Comfort, seated
themselves about a table, ordered their lunch, and
while waiting for and eating it did a good deal of
talking.</p>

<p>Hetty was the chief speaker. She began the instant
they were seated:</p>

<p>“We’ve been to the sea-shore, mother and I, and
it’s about some people we saw on the train, as we
came up to the city, that I want to tell you, Floy.
Such a nice-looking family&mdash;father, mother, one son,
and two daughters. And the strangest thing is that
the mother and the oldest girl look very much like
you.”</p>

<p>At these words Ethel’s heart beat so fast and loud
it seemed to her they all must hear it, and her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
trembled so that she was obliged to set down the cup
she was in the act of lifting to her lips.</p>

<p>Hetty saw her agitation, and made haste with her
story.</p>

<p>“The girl looked about fifteen. The mother,
I should say, might be anywhere between thirty and
forty, and very handsome; has the sweetest face!
Her husband, a noble-looking man, watched over
and waited on her as if it were the greatest pleasure
in life to do so&mdash;with a sort of pitying tenderness, so
it seemed to me. And I saw her give him such a
look once, as if she thought he was&mdash;well, as mother
says, ‘superior to the best.’ But when she was not
speaking or listening to him there would come a far-off
look into her eyes, an expression as if she had
known some great sorrow, some life-long trial that
she had schooled herself to bear with patient resignation.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Hetty, how much you see that common
folks like me would never think of!” put in
her mother admiringly as the girl paused for breath.</p>

<p>Ethel, contrary to her usual good manners, made
an impatient movement, and Hetty hastily resumed
her narrative.</p>

<p>“You see my attention was drawn to her as they
came in, for they were a little late, and had some
difficulty in finding seats&mdash;couldn’t all get together
at first; then the resemblance to you, which even
mother noticed when I spoke of it to her, and the
quick, searching glance she sent round the car&mdash;for
all the world as you would have done, because you
are always looking for your lost mother. She
seemed to scan every face, then sat down with, so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
least I thought, a weary, disappointed little sigh; and
it was then I noticed the pitying tenderness of her
husband’s manner. Then the older girl spoke to her,
calling her mamma, and I noticed that in her there
was a still more striking likeness to you&mdash;though
only, I think, because she is so much nearer your
age.”</p>

<p>Ethel had forgotten to eat or drink; she was trembling
with agitation.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all?” she asked in tones scarcely audible,
as Hetty again paused a moment.</p>

<p>“Not quite, dear. The little girl at first sat on her
brother’s knee; then a seat was vacated just in front
of me, and she took it. I smiled at her, and she
smiled back. I was eager to make acquaintance,
that I might find out something about them; so
presently I leaned over to her and asked if she had
been at the sea-shore. She said, ‘Yes, and now we’re
going back to the Centennial. We were there a
while, but mamma got very tired one day&mdash;so tired
she and papa couldn’t go in to look at the pictures
with Ellis and me, and we went home instead; and
we were to go to the picture place the next morning,
but mamma was taken very sick in the night, and
the doctor said she must go to the sea-shore for a
while; so of course we all went.’</p>

<p>“Then she took to questioning me, and telling me
about the shells she had picked and the fun she had
had in bathing, and what she had seen and expected
to see at the Exposition.</p>

<p>“I asked her her name, and she said it was ‘Nan’
something; I couldn’t quite catch the last name,
but it was a word of two syllables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I sat silent a while, racking my brains to
think what I could do to find out whether they really
were related to you, and had just decided to tell the
child that I knew a young lady who strongly resembled
her mother and sister, when some persons left
the car, and she changed her seat again for one
nearer the rest of the family.”</p>

<p>“And that is all?” Ethel said, drawing a long,
sighing breath as Hetty ceased.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, all,” Hetty answered regretfully, laying
her hand tenderly on her friend’s arm. “I wish
for your sake there was something more&mdash;something
certain.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ethel hid her face in her hands;
then taking them away, turned toward Hetty, pale,
tearful, but with the light of hope shining in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“It was my mother,” she whispered. “Something
tells me so, and that I shall find her&mdash;we shall find
each other at last.”</p>

<p>A young man had stepped upon the threshold of
the outer door, and was sending a hurried glance
about the now crowded room. His eye lighted up
as it fell upon Ethel’s graceful figure and fair face,
of which he could get but a partial view from where
he stood.</p>

<p>In another instant she rose and turned toward
him. Their eyes met, she nodded and smiled, said
a few words to her companions, then made her way
through the throng to his side as he stepped back
upon the porch, the other two following.</p>

<p>Arrived in his vicinity, she introduced Mr. Alden
to Mrs. and Miss Goodenough. A shaking of hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
and exchange of a few commonplace sentences followed,
and the four separated, Hetty and her
mother returning to the Main Building, while Ethel
and Espy sauntered side by side along the avenue in
the direction of Memorial Hall, passing it and going
some distance beyond.</p>

<p>Although thousands of people were wandering
about the houses and grounds, this spacious thoroughfare
was not so crowded that they could not
with ease keep to themselves and carry on a private
conversation without danger of being overheard.</p>

<p>In a few moments Espy had learned from Ethel all
that Hetty had had to tell of her fellow-passengers
of the previous day.</p>

<p>His interest and excitement were only second to
Ethel’s, and he shared both her conviction and her
presentiment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said eagerly, “it is your mother! I
seem somehow to feel that it must be so; and now
the question is how to bring you together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Ethel, “we might all be here every
day while the Exhibition lasts, yet never meet. But
no, I will not fear it! I will trust in God, who hath
helped me hitherto,” she added, smiling brightly
through gathering tears.</p>

<p>Espy regarded her with admiring, loving eyes.</p>

<p>“That is right!” he said cheerfully, “and I feel
sure your faith will be rewarded. You are looking
tired; let us sit down here and rest while we talk it
over.”</p>

<p>He had led her into a side path, and to a bench
that stood in the shade of a wide-spreading tree.</p>

<p>“It may sound conceited,” he said, “but I do believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
that my pictures are now to play a conspicuous
part in the drama and do you good service&mdash;as truly
they ought, being mine, and I your humble slave,”
he added sportively, seeking to win her from anxiety
and care.</p>

<p>She smiled, but sadly still, as she made answer:
“I hope they may; but how is it to be managed?
It is with them as with the rest of the Exposition&mdash;we
and those we seek may visit them again and
again, yet never at the same time.”</p>

<p>He mused a moment.</p>

<p>“They would perhaps think of inquiring for the
artist in case your mother recognizes the likenesses,
as I do feel pretty confident she will, at least if she
has a good memory for faces; for surely Mrs. Kemper’s,
and yours as a baby, would be likely to be
strongly impressed upon it. And we must go there
very often, singly or together.”</p>

<p>“And trust to Providence to bring us there at the
right moment,” she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>A moment of silent musing on the part of both,
and Ethel suddenly sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“I will go there now&mdash;this moment!”</p>

<p>“And may I go with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; come!” and she started almost on a
run.</p>

<p>“Floy, Floy, not quite so fast!” he said, exerting
himself to keep pace with her. “You will be all
out of breath, and have no strength to push through
the crowd.”</p>

<p>She slackened her speed and took his offered arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right; I shall have need of all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
strength. But oh, if I should be a moment too
late!”</p>

<p>“Try to be calm, dear Floy,” he said low and
tenderly, gazing down upon the agitated face in loving
solicitude. “You have been very brave and
hopeful thus far, and are, I trust, soon to be rewarded
for it all. But try to be calm and collected. You
will need to have full command of yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will try,” she answered with a deep-drawn
sigh; “and oh, I am glad and thankful that I have
you with me, Espy!”</p>

<p>“Bless you, darling, for the words!” he said,
flushing with pleasure. “To be a comfort and support
to you has long been the dearest wish of my
heart.”</p>

<p>He led her on in the direction from which they had
come at a rapid but steady pace, watching anxiously
the while the changes in her speaking countenance.
He was relieved to see a calm, peaceful, quiet look
presently take the place of the painful agitation visible
there a moment before.</p>

<p>He knew not the cause, but she had fled to the
Rock that was higher than she. Whatever might
befall, this Refuge could not fail, this Friend would
never forsake.</p>

<p>While Ethel had sat listening with absorbing interest
to Hetty’s story the persons of whom they spoke
were in Horticultural Hall, which they left at nearly
the same time that the first party separated and went
their several ways.</p>

<p>“Memorial Hall comes next on our programme,
does it not, wife?” said the older gentleman as they
descended the steps of the main entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “but let us walk about here a
little first; the sun is under a cloud at this moment,
and these parterres and rustic seats are worth looking
at.”</p>

<p>“They are lovely, mamma,” said the older girl;
“but I’ve seen them several times, and I want to buy
some little things at the Japanese Bazaar. So may I
go on? and I’ll meet you in the avenue near the Art
Building.”</p>

<p>Permission was given, and she tripped away. The
others soon followed. Presently she came running
breathlessly to meet them.</p>

<p>“Papa, mamma, I’ve had an adventure! An
elderly gentleman rushed up to me, holding out his
hand in the most cordial manner and looking as
pleased as if he had just come upon his best friend
after a long separation. ‘Why, Floy, my dear child,
I am delighted to see you!’ he said, but I of course
drew back and told him as politely as I could that
he had made a mistake; that was not my name, and
I was quite sure we had never met before. Then he
grew very red in the face, and stammered out an
apology. He had taken me for a young lady he
used to know very well indeed, but hadn’t seen
for two or three years; hoped I would excuse him,
but really the resemblance was wonderful.”</p>

<p>“A mere pretence, you may depend!” cried her
brother angrily. “And, Dora, you are not to go
alone into a crowd again; you are quite too young
and pretty.”</p>

<p>But the mother appeared strangely agitated.
“Oh, my child, where is he?” she cried, trembling
and turning pale. “Oh, if I had but seen him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Which way did he go? could you point him out to
your father or me?”</p>

<p>“I think I should recognize him if I met him
again,” the girl answered in surprise, “but I do
not at all know where he went. But why, mamma,
why should you wish to see him?”</p>

<p>The mother did not answer, did not seem to have
heard the question. She was leaning heavily upon
her husband’s arm for support, while he bent over
her with low-breathed words of comfort and hope.</p>

<p>“Dear wife, bear up! What is this but another
gleam of light for you?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Dora,” whispered the lad, drawing his
sister aside. “Can you not guess? have you forgotten
our mother’s quest&mdash;her life-long sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ellis! to be sure! How could I be so stupid!
Oh, why didn’t I think to detain and question
the man? But, Ellis, it wasn’t the right name.”</p>

<p>“No; but what is easier than to change a name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is true! Poor mamma! poor
dear mamma! She will never rest; she cannot, till
she finds her or knows that she is no more.”</p>

<p>“She has such a loving mother-heart,” said Ellis,
“and she <em>will</em> blame herself, though I’m sure she has
no reason.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked little Nan,
coming skipping back from an erratic excursion into
one of the side paths. “Oh, Dora! did you get me
that necklace?”</p>

<p>“Yes, little puss, I have it safe here in my bag.”</p>

<p>“Let me carry that; I did not notice that you had
it,” Ellis said, taking the satchel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>He was invariably as politely attentive to his
mother and sisters as to any other ladies.</p>

<p>The parents were moving slowly forward, the
mother having recovered her accustomed calm, quiet
manner, and the young people had fallen slightly
into the rear. Another moment, and they were all
passing up the broad marble steps leading into Memorial
Hall.</p>

<p>They had hardly disappeared within the portal,
when Espy and Ethel might have been seen traversing
the avenue in the same direction.</p>

<p>Indifferent as to which part of the building received
their first attention, the foremost party turned,
as it were by a mere chance, into that appropriated
to the exhibition of native talent. They moved
slowly along, the parents still in advance, pausing
as others were doing, now here, now there, as one
painting or another drew their attention.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lady grasped her husband’s arm, a
low, half-stifled cry escaping her lips. Was it joy?
Was it anguish? It seemed a mingling of both.</p>

<p>“What is it, wife?” he asked in a startled tone, and
throwing the other arm around her, for she seemed
about to faint.</p>

<p>“Look, look!” she said, pointing to Espy’s picture
of the child, beneath which they were standing.
“It is&mdash;it is my baby! my little Ethel! my lost darling!”
she sobbed half inarticulately, gazing at it
with streaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried her husband, “is it possible! My
darling, are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is she! Could a mother’s eyes be
deceived? Can a mother’s heart forget? And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
woman&mdash;the one who took her from me! That is
her face. I remember perfectly every lineament.
Oh, Rolfe, Rolfe, it is my lost baby! And there,”
pointing to the companion picture, “there she is,
grown to womanhood! Is not this a clue?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; the artist&mdash;we must find him.”</p>

<p>Their tones had not been loud, yet, in connection
with the lady’s evident agitation, had attracted some
notice, and a younger pair had hurriedly pushed
their way toward them, coming up so close in their
rear as to catch the last two or three sentences.</p>

<p>“I am the artist,” said Espy, “and this,” glancing
at Ethel as the others turned quickly at the
sound of his voice, “is the original of those two&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your name? your name?” gasped the lady, gazing
eagerly, longingly, into the pale, excited face of
the girl.</p>

<p>“Is Ethel Farnese. My mother’s was the same;
and she, a widow, poor, dying as she believed, gave
me to that woman&mdash;Mrs. Kemper.”</p>

<p>“I knew it! I knew it! My child! my long-lost
child!” and instantly they were locked in each
other’s arms, Ethel sobbing:</p>

<p>“Mother, mother! my own darling mother!”</p>

<p>Madame Le Conte had remained at home that day,
had slept all the morning, and now, in the latter part
of the afternoon, was occupying a lounging chair in
her boudoir and amusing herself with a novel.</p>

<p>“Hark! wasn’t that a carriage stopping at our
door?” she said, looking up from her book and addressing
her maid. “Yes, there’s a ring.”</p>

<p>“Katty’ll go. It’s Miss Ethel come home early, I
presume, Madame,” answered Mary, not troubling
herself to rise from her chair.</p>

<p>There was the sound of Kathleen’s step in the
hall, the opening of the door, a man’s voice speaking,
then the girl came quickly up the stairs and appeared
before her mistress.</p>

<p>“Mr. Alden, Madame, and he wants to know may
he come up here and spake till ye? Oh, don’t go for
to be scared! Miss Ethel’s all right,” as the Madame
turned pale and half rose from her chair.</p>

<p>“Bring him up then,” she gasped, falling back
again and panting for breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>She put no faith in Kathleen’s assurance, and was
terribly alarmed. To lose Ethel would be almost
like losing her own life.</p>

<p>But one glance at Espy’s face reassured her.</p>

<p>“Ah, Madame,” he said cheerily, declining by a
wave of the hand the seat she pointed to, “I met a
gentleman out at the Centennial who says he is a
very old friend of yours, and would like much to see
and speak with you. I have brought him to the
house, feeling pretty sure you would be pleased to
see him, but thought best to give you a little warning
and an opportunity to decline doing so if you
wished.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He requested me not to give his name, as he is
anxious to see if you will recognize him.”</p>

<p>The lady’s curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will see him,” she said. “You may
bring him up here at once; I am quite ready for the
interview.”</p>

<p>The stranger, apparently troubled with no doubt
that he would be received, had crept noiselessly up
the stairs and was already almost at the door of the
boudoir. Espy had only to turn and give him a
nod, and instantly he stepped forward and stood before
Madame Le Conte&mdash;a tall, handsome, middle-aged
man.</p>

<p>But he started with amazement as his eye fell
upon her face and figure.</p>

<p>“Do I&mdash;do I see before me my old acquaintance,
Nannette Gramont?”</p>

<p>“That was my maiden name,” she said, gazing
earnestly into his face as she half rose and held out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
her left hand, “but I am greatly altered, as I think
you must be also, for your looks are utterly strange
to me.”</p>

<p>“Rolfe Heywood,” he said, taking the offered
hand while still keenly scanning her face.</p>

<p>“Rolfe Heywood! is it possible? can it be? Ah,
yes, I know you now; I remember your smile. But&mdash;oh,
can you tell me anything of my sister&mdash;my lost
Ethel&mdash;my darling Pansy?”</p>

<p>The words came pantingly, sobbingly, while great
tears chased each other down the bloated, swarthy
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes, Nannette, she has been my wife&mdash;my beloved
wife&mdash;for many years,” he said with emotion, thinking
of the shock her sister’s changed appearance
would give to the gentle, loving heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God! thank God! Then she has not
perished with want! I have not the darling’s blood
on my hands!” cried the Madame, sinking back into
her chair and weeping as if in bitterest grief.</p>

<p>“No, Nannette, though she was once very near
it,” he said, bending over her and speaking in a very
low tone.</p>

<p>“Do not reproach me!” she cried. “I too have
suffered! God only knows how much!”</p>

<p>He signed to the wondering Mary to leave the
room. His look, his gesture, were imperative, and
the girl reluctantly obeyed.</p>

<p>“Poor creature!” he said, turning to the Madame
again, “I do not reproach you, nor does she. No, her
gentle heart is&mdash;has ever been&mdash;filled with sisterly
affection toward you, and she now waits impatiently
to be summoned to your presence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>“Waits, do you say? Is she here?&mdash;my sister&mdash;my
darling! Where? where? Oh, I beseech you
not to keep us another moment apart!”</p>

<p>And she started up, wringing her hands and looking
imploringly into his face.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Nannette; this agitation will
hurt you,” he said in a kindly tone, gently forcing
her back into her chair. “Your niece&mdash;my Ethel’s
dear child&mdash;has told us of your invalid state, and I
see that this excitement has almost deprived you of
the power to breathe.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to talk now!” she panted, pushing
him from her. “I shall go wild! Go, go and bring
her! Bring her, or I shall die before your eyes!”
And she struggled frantically for breath.</p>

<p>He was frightened lest she should indeed fail to
recover it. He glanced hurriedly about the room,
sprang to the bell-pull, but as he laid his hand on it,
Mary, listening at an inner door, threw it open and
rushed in.</p>

<p>“You’d better have let me stay, you see, sir,” she
said a little sarcastically. “But don’t be scared.
It’s more hysterics than anything else, and they’re
not dangerous. I’ll bring her round presently.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you go?” gasped the Madame, looking
at her visitor and drawing a long breath that
ended in almost a shriek.</p>

<p>“As soon as you are calm, Nannette,” he answered
pityingly; “but till then I dare not bring
her.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go out, sir, and I’ll call you the
moment she’s fit,” said Mary. And he went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Espy, standing in the open door of an opposite
room, beckoned Mr. Heywood in there.</p>

<p>Downstairs mother and daughter waited, in no
haste to be called; for what greater joy than to be as
they were now for the first time in so many, many
years&mdash;alone together, and clasped in each other’s
arms, cheek to cheek and heart to heart.</p>

<p>They sat in silence, broken only now and then by a
sob (for the deepest joy is strangely akin to grief in
its outward manifestations) or a whispered word of
endearment.</p>

<p>“My precious, precious child! my long-lost darling!”</p>

<p>“Mother, mother! sweetest, dearest, darling
mother!”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Heywood who at length broke in upon
the glad interview.</p>

<p>“Ethel, love, my dear wife,” and his hand touched
her hair gently, caressingly, “she will see you now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood started, strained her new-found
daughter once more to her bosom with a long,
silent, most tender caress, and, releasing her, left
the room, leaning on her husband’s arm. She needed
its strong support, for she was trembling very much.</p>

<p>“Be calm, love,” he whispered, bending over her
and just touching his lips to her fair, open brow, as
he paused with her at the foot of the stairs. “One
moment. I must prepare you to find your sister
much changed&mdash;greatly broken in health, yet not,
I think, with any dangerous disease,” he hastened to
add as he saw a look of anguish come into her eyes,
the color suddenly fade out of her cheek, leaving it
of an almost death-like pallor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank God for that!” she whispered faintly,
“but how?&mdash;what?&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She seems to be somewhat asthmatic and very
nervous; has grown immensely fat, lost her clear complexion,
vivacity of look and manner, and, I think,
partially the use of her right hand also. She gave
me the left in greeting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rolfe! is it so?&mdash;all that? My poor, poor
dear sister!” she murmured, tears trickling down
the pale cheeks.</p>

<p>He soothed her grief as tenderly as she would that
of her little Nannette&mdash;the namesake of this beloved
only sister&mdash;and at length, when she had grown
calm again, half carried her up the stairs.</p>

<p>The Madame, listening to their approach, was
threatened with a renewal of her hysterics, but
Mary was equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>“Madame, Madame,” she said hastily, “calm
yourself, or I shall have to call to them not to come
in.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you shall do no such thing!” cried her
mistress, controlling her nerves by a mighty effort;
then, as at that instant the slender, graceful figure of
Mrs. Heywood appeared in the doorway, she sprang
up with a cry, extending both arms, while her huge
frame trembled from head to foot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood flew to meet the offered embrace.
“Nannette, Nannette!” and tears fell fast as lip
met lip in a long, clinging kiss.</p>

<p>“Pansy, Pansy! oh, my little Pansy! my darling!
my wronged, long-suffering, abused little sister!”
sobbed the Madame, holding her close, “can you,
will you, forgive me, dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>“With all my heart, my own Nannette,” returned
Ethel, weeping on her neck. Then, lifting her
head and gazing tenderly into the agitated face so
painfully changed to her, and noting the tumultuous
heaving of the broad chest, “Oh, my poor, poor
dear sister, how changed you are! how ill! You
seem hardly able to breathe!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have suffered,” panted the Madame. “I
have mourned and wept over your loss, Pansy, and
for many years have been constantly searching for
you. Heaven be praised, darling, that I have found
you at last!”</p>

<p>The last words were spoken gaspingly, and Ethel
felt the stout arms relaxing their hold on her. Mr.
Heywood sprang forward just in time to save his sister-in-law
from falling, and with Mary’s assistance
got her into her chair again, where she lay back on
her cushions wheezing and panting in a way that
greatly alarmed her sister.</p>

<p>Mary reassured her:</p>

<p>“It is nothing, ma’am. You’d know that if you’d
been with her as long as I have. She’ll get over it
in a few minutes. You see she gets kind of upset
with anything that excites her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Heywood knelt by the side of the chair, and,
with tears streaming over her cheeks, took the Madame’s
hand in hers, stroked it, and talked to her in
soothing tones with loving, tender, pitying words,
while Mr. Heywood stood by plying a fan and the
maid administered remedies.</p>

<p>Our heroine, left alone in the parlor below, paced
excitedly to and fro for several minutes; then dropping
into a chair, rested her elbows on a table and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Her heart was swelling with joy unutterable and
thankfulness to that heavenly Friend who had been
her ever-present help in time of trouble, her comfort
and support in the dark days of adversity, and had at
length brought her quest to this happy ending, and
she was sending up to Him her silent but most fervent
thanksgivings.</p>

<p>In an adjoining room three young people had been
sitting for the last half-hour or more, very quiet and
still, yet full of an eager expectancy that made the
waiting time seem very long and tedious. They exchanged
glances, and drew nearer together as Mr. and
Mrs. Heywood mounted the stairway.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Ellis?” whispered one.
“She’s in there all alone, and must we wait till some
one comes to take us in and introduce us in due
form?”</p>

<p>“No, Dora, I should say not. Why should we?
Come, both of you. I’ll be spokesman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel heard the approaching footsteps, quiet, almost
stealthy as they were, and taking her hands
from her face, turned it toward them.</p>

<p>A lad with a noble face and gentlemanly manner,
a fair young girl whom to look upon was like seeing
her own reflection in the glass, except that this
face was somewhat more youthful, lacking the maturity,
sorrow, and care far more than years had
brought to hers, and a little girl with a sweet, winsome
face, blue eyes, and soft, flaxen curls, stood before
her.</p>

<p>“Excuse us if we seem intruders,” said the lad,
with a courtly bow and offering his hand, “but we
don’t know how to wait till some older person shall
find time to introduce us, for we know we have a
right in you, if you will pardon me for saying it;
but these are your sisters and mine, and I am your
brother. Their names are Dora and Nannette Heywood,
and mine is Ellis.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad, glad!” cried Ethel, her face
sparkling with pleasure as she embraced each in
turn, then made them sit down, and called Katty to
bring refreshments. “I am so happy, so happy!”
she said, glancing from one to another with tears of
joy trembling in her eyes. “To have found my
dear, dear mother, for whom I’ve been searching for
years, seems to fill my cup of bliss to overflowing;
and now I have a dear brother and sisters in addition&mdash;oh,
it seems too much delight for one heart to
hold!”</p>

<p>The tears fairly rolled down in a shower as she
concluded, and Dora, springing up, threw her arms
about her neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I love you already!” she cried. “Dear
Ethel, dear sister!”</p>

<p>“Sister!” Ethel exclaimed. “Ah, I never thought
to find any one who had the right to call me that! I
had dear, adopted parents, who, until the day of
their death, I supposed were indeed my own, but I
never had a brother or sister, and I have often envied
those who had. But how is it that I did not see you
before, and that you know all about me?” she asked,
looking from sister to brother.</p>

<p>“We were not far in the rear of our parents when
they came upon the picture, and we heard and saw
all that passed,” said Ellis.</p>

<p>“And understood it,” added Dora with eager animation,
“for all our lives long mamma has talked
to us of her dear, first-born baby, her darling little
Ethel, lost in so sad a manner, and we have known
that she was always looking for you and hoping to
find you. Poor dear mamma!”</p>

<p>“Dear, happy mamma now!” corrected Ellis,
with a smile and an affectionate, admiring glance at
his newly-discovered sister.</p>

<p>For a short space overpowering emotion kept
Ethel silent. How sweet it was to know that there
had never been a time since her birth when she had
not had a warm place in that loving mother-heart!</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dora, “you are right there, Ellis.
What joy there was in her face&mdash;although she was
weeping, too&mdash;as I caught sight of it as papa helped
her into the carriage that brought them here, and
placed sister Ethel by her side.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Ethel, with sudden recollection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
“that you did not come with us&mdash;you
three. How did you get here?”</p>

<p>“The artist gave us the address while father was
putting you ladies into the hack,” replied Ellis.
“He told us, too, that it was our aunt’s house; and
knowing that you were our sister we felt pretty
secure of a welcome, so followed on. The distance,
you know, is not great, and the street-cars brought
us part of the way.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ellis, let our new sister talk awhile; I
think it’s her turn,” said Nannette; and coming to
Ethel’s side, and looking coaxingly into her face,
“Won’t you please tell us where you’ve been all this
time, and what you’ve been doing?” she asked.
“How could you ever do without mamma, ’specially
when you had no papa either?”</p>

<p>“I have wanted her very, very much since&mdash;since
my dear adopted mother died,” Ethel answered,
tears trembling in her eyes, while she put her arms
about the child and kissed her tenderly. “Yes, little
sister, I will tell you what you have asked,” and she
went on to give a rapid sketch of her life, dwelling
more at length upon her early childhood than on the
events of after-years.</p>

<p>All three listened with intense interest, one or another
putting an occasional question when there was
a pause in her narrative.</p>

<p>Then she asked for a return of her confidence, and
her request was granted with evident pleasure. Ellis
was the chief speaker, the girls now and then assisting
his memory till they had given Ethel quite a
clear idea of their home life.</p>

<p>A very charming picture it seemed to her, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
heart swelled with increasing joy and gratitude at the
thought that she would now have a place in that
happy family&mdash;the place of one who possessed an
equal right there with the others, and joyfully acknowledged
by them, for Mr. Heywood had already
embraced and called her “daughter” in such tender,
fatherly fashion that she could not doubt her
welcome from him.</p>

<p>Espy, having seen the door of Madame Le Conte’s
boudoir close upon Mr. and Mrs. Heywood, stole
softly down the stairs, thinking to join his Floy in
the parlor. But as he neared the half-open door he
caught a glimpse of Ellis and his sisters, and heard
the voice of the latter, who was at that moment making
his little introductory speech.</p>

<p>Espy turned away and quietly left the house, unable
to reason down a jealous feeling, which he was
only dimly conscious was such, that he was no longer
necessary to Floy’s happiness.</p>

<p>“I will not go back again to-night,” he said to
himself. “She will not miss me.”</p>

<p>He had fully sympathized in her joy over the discovery
of her long-sought parent, and he was very glad
for her even now; but physically weary, and suffering
from the exhaustion consequent upon the reaction
from great excitement, he began to be oppressed
with gloomy thoughts and forebodings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>“These people are rich,” he soliloquized. “They
will despise me for my poverty, will want Floy to
give me up for some wealthier suitor; and if they
fail in that, will make the poor darling wretched by
their opposition. Yes, that’s just how it will be;
it’s always the way; the more people have the more
they want.” And at that moment he almost hated
the gentle, sweet-faced woman and noble-looking
man whom an hour ago he had most heartily admired.</p>

<p>Arrived at his hotel, he was hurrying to his room,
intending to shut himself up there to the undisturbed
indulgence of his dismal prognostications, when his
steps were arrested by a waiter, who handed him a
card, saying:</p>

<p>“The gentleman’s in his room, sir&mdash;No. 58, second
floor&mdash;and wishes you to call on him there, sir. Told
me to deliver card and message right away when
you came in.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Espy answered shortly, and obeyed
the summons at once. The card was his father’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Alden was in excellent spirits, and greeted his
son with effusion. He was glad to see him looking so
well; hoped his affairs were prospering as regarded
both the paintings and his relations to Floy.</p>

<p>Then, hardly waiting for a reply, he went on:</p>

<p>“I’ve had a delightful time; got back this morning;
landed from the train at the Centennial; spent
the day there; and, by the way, I met a young thing
out there this afternoon who is wonderfully like Floy.
Took her for her at first sight, and made a fool of
myself by rushing up and offering to shake hands.
Have been cogitating on the subject, and come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
conclusion that it may be a younger sister&mdash;half-sister,
you know&mdash;supposing the mother lived and married
again. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Floy <em>has</em> a sister&mdash;two of them, in fact,” returned
the son dryly, “and I think it altogether probable
that the girl you speak of was one of them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” cried Mr. Alden in astonishment.
“And she’s found her mother, has she?”</p>

<p>“She has.”</p>

<p>“And sisters too?”</p>

<p>“And brother and step-father; there’s a whole
family.”</p>

<p>“Whew! So many more to inherit the old Madame’s
estate! Bad thing for Floy that!”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t think so,” retorted Espy indignantly.
“I never saw her look so unutterably happy, and I
honor her for it.”</p>

<p>“Humph! you do, eh? And what effect will all
this have on <em>your</em> prospects? Will the new-found parents
approve the choice of the lovely heiress?”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen, sir,” Espy answered,
coloring deeply and half averting his face. “It is
not many hours since the first meeting of mother and
daughter after their long separation, and, of course,
they have not yet been able to think beyond the present
moment.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, my boy, I hope no objection will be
raised; but if there should be, don’t you be too ready
to give her up. And it’s my belief that she’ll stick
to you through thick and thin.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir; she might deem it her duty
to wait for her mother’s consent,” Espy answered
despondingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, yes, maybe so. I remember she has a
troublesome conscience, or streak of stubbornness,
whichever you please to call it. But don’t borrow
trouble. Many a one would think a rising young
artist of good disposition, respectable family, and
fine appearance not a very bad match even for an
heiress,” remarked the elder gentleman, regarding
his son with a proudly affectionate smile.</p>

<p>“If they could see him through his father’s eyes,”
Espy said, returning the smile, more reassured and
comforted by the fatherly flattery than he cared to
own even to himself. But when he had retired to
the solitude of his own room he presently returned
to his bitter and desponding mood. How could he feel
sure even that Floy might not in time be weaned
from him by these new-found relatives in case they
did not fancy the match, seeing that already she was
so taken up with them that he was quite forgotten?
The greater part of the night was spent in gratuitous
self-torture, but toward morning he fell into a sound
sleep, from which he did not wake till the sun was
several hours high.</p>

<p>He started up with a confused feeling that something
was wrong. Then it all came back to him in a
flash&mdash;yesterday’s happy ending of Floy’s quest, with
its attendant scenes.</p>

<p>His first emotion was, as before, one of keen sympathy
in her abounding joy, but this was speedily replaced
by the jealous pangs, the doubts and fears,
from which sleep had brought him temporary relief.
Upon inquiry he learned that his father, with whom
the keeping of early hours was a life-long habit, had
already breakfasted and gone out. Then the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
suggested itself whether he himself should go, as
usual, to Madame Le Conte’s to learn Floy’s plans
for the day, and become her escort to the Exposition
or elsewhere, if such were her pleasure.</p>

<p>He held the point in debate for a time, but finally
decided to stay away for the morning at least, saying
gloomily to himself:</p>

<p>“She will not need me, very likely will not so
much as miss me; and the others will most assuredly
not desire my presence.”</p>

<p>The morning and most of the afternoon were passed
in tedious lounging in the gentlemen’s reading-room
of the hotel and aimless wanderings about the city
streets. Then the longing to see Floy, and learn what
effect these changes really were likely to have upon
his future relations with her, became so overpowering
that he turned his steps perforce toward the
Madame’s dwelling. It was Ethel herself who admitted
him.</p>

<p>“I knew it was your ring,” she said, hastily closing
the door and lifting to his a face perfectly radiant
with joy and gladness.</p>

<p>He had been reproaching himself only a moment
before for the anxiety and sadness his absence had
probably caused her, but it seemed she had felt nothing
of the kind.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought he, “it is plain to be seen that I
am no longer necessary to her happiness.”</p>

<p>“But what is the matter?” she asked, the brightness
suddenly dying out of her face as she caught
the dismal expression of his. “Are you ill, dear
Espy? Have the pictures been abused by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
cruel critics? I feared something was wrong when I
found you were staying away so long.”</p>

<p>“Did you, indeed? I’m sorry, but hope it has
not troubled you greatly,” he returned in a slightly
sarcastic tone. “No, there is nothing wrong with
<em>me</em>,” putting a meaning emphasis on the personal
pronoun.</p>

<p>She gave him a surprised, hurt look, but merely
said in a quiet tone:</p>

<p>“Come into the parlor, Espy. There is no one
there.”</p>

<p>He followed her in, feeling ashamed of himself, but,
too proud to show it, put on an indifferent air, and
leaning against the mantel, toyed idly with its ornaments,
leaving it to her to break the silence that succeeded
their entrance.</p>

<p>“Espy, is this kind? is it generous?” she said at
length.</p>

<p>“Is what? I’m doing no mischief here,” he said,
willfully misunderstanding her; but turning, and seeing
the pained expression of her face, his better nature
conquered. “No, Floy, darling, it is neither!
it is shameful!” he cried, hurrying to her and taking
both hands in his. “But the demon of jealousy has
taken possession of me. I see now that it is that.”</p>

<p>“Jealousy! of whom?” she asked in surprise, but
not repulsing him.</p>

<p>“Of&mdash;of your mother, brother, sisters,” he said,
coloring with shame. “There! it is out; and what
do you think of your lover now?”</p>

<p>“That he is&mdash;what shall I say? more fond than
wise?” and she looked up brightly, the red lips smiling,
the large, lustrous eyes a trifle misty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s kiss and make up, as the children say,” he
whispered, bending over her till his mustache came
in suspiciously close proximity to her face.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> haven’t been quarrelling,” she returned, with
an arch smile.</p>

<p>They sat down side by side on a sofa.</p>

<p>“I have missed you, naughty boy,” she said, still
playfully, “because I wanted somebody to tell my
gladness to, if for no other reason. Oh, Espy!” and
her tone changed to one of deep feeling, “I am so
blest! I seem to have nothing more to ask for! I,
who have been such a lonely waif, have now found
not only the mother I have been so long almost
hopelessly seeking (and such a dear, darling mother,
too), but father, brother, sisters, and even grand-parents.
Old Mr. and Mrs. Heywood were here this
morning&mdash;they are the loveliest old couple!&mdash;and
took me right to their hearts, bidding me call them
grandpa and grandma, as my brother and sisters do.”</p>

<p>“Very strange, <em>very</em>!” remarked Espy, with a smile
that belied his words. “Ah, Floy,” he added with
a sigh, “I only wish I had some assurance that <em>I</em>
shall find equal favor with them, or at least with
your mother.”</p>

<p>“You need have no fears, Espy,” she said. “My
mother and I passed the night together in each
other’s arms&mdash;she sharing my bed&mdash;but not sleeping
much, you may be sure. We talked till daybreak,
each giving the other an account of her life during
the years of our separation. I told her all about
you&mdash;yes, everything&mdash;and she fully approves my
choice, is ready to give you a son’s place in her dear,
warm heart, only she says we must not ask to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
for a year or more (which you know we did not expect
to do anyhow), because she must have me for a
little while.”</p>

<p>His face was radiant.</p>

<p>“Bless her!” he cried. “I was afraid she would
object to my poverty, particularly as I imagine them
to be very wealthy.”</p>

<p>“Mother says they are not that; only comfortably
well-to-do. Their home is in that land of fruit and
flowers, Santa Barbara, and Aunt Nannette has already
promised to go with them on their return and
make her home there, and&mdash;ah, don’t look so dismal,
for though I, of course, cannot consent to be
left behind, all want you to go also and settle there.”</p>

<p>“I’ve not the least objection; in fact, am delighted
with the idea!” he said with animation.
“And so it’s all arranged! Everything has come out
right in spite of the doubts and fears with which I’ve
been tormenting myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there was no need,” she said gayly; “but</p>

<p>“Burns was a sage,” he remarked, laughing, “but
I can’t say that I find the application particularly
complimentary. And you are not disappointed in
your mother?”</p>

<p>“Disappointed! I would not have her different
in any respect. I find, to my unspeakable joy, that,
besides possessing the sweetest natural disposition,
she is an earnest, devoted Christian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad for your sake. Where is she now? I
should like to see her again.”</p>

<p>“Stay and spend the evening with us, and you
shall. Just now she is lying down. I persuaded her to
try to take a nap while Aunt Nannette was doing so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Then I will come back,” he said,
rising, “but I must leave now for a while. I had forgotten
a business letter that must go by the next
mail.”</p>

<p>He went, and Ethel stole softly upstairs to her
own room and sat down there to think over her great
happiness&mdash;so great that hardly yet could she fully
believe in its reality. Presently she started up, and
going to a bureau-drawer, took from it the old,
worn, faded pocket-book that, because of her love for
the departed, in whose service its brightness had
grown dim, was so precious a relic. A moment she
stood gazing upon it, a tender dewiness in her soft,
bright eyes, then opening, drew forth a tiny folded
paper. A light, quick step coming from an adjoining
room caused her to turn her head.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she cried in low, musical tones, rapturous
with love and gladness.</p>

<p>“Darling daughter!” Mrs. Heywood responded,
putting her arms about the slender, girlish figure,
and folding it to her heart with a tender caress.</p>

<p>Their joy, though no longer expressed in tears,
was still almost too deep for words.</p>

<p>For several moments they stood holding each other
in a silent embrace; then Ethel, putting the folded
paper into her mother’s hand, said:</p>

<p>“Here, dear mamma, is a proof of my identity
that till now I had forgotten to produce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is altogether unnecessary, my precious child,”
Mrs. Heywood answered, opening the paper as she
spoke. But as her eye glanced down the written
page her cheek suddenly paled, and she uttered a
low cry.</p>

<p>“This!” she said, with a shudder, “my contract
with Mr. Kemper! Child, child, put it into the fire!
Never let me see it again! Oh, what the signing of
it has cost me!”</p>

<p class="center space_above">THE END.</p>
